the\\\\nyears with comments on my books, and especially those who have\\\\ncontributed ideas to this new edition of The Rules of Work. In partic-\\\\nular, may I thank: \\\\n\\\\nAnil Baddela \\\\n\\\\nJohnson Maganja Grace \\\\n\\\\nDavid Grigor \\\\n\\\\nFrank Hull \\\\n\\\\nHubert Rau \\\\n\\\\nPawan Singh \\\\n\\\\nTina Steel\\\\n\\\\nviiAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nForeword\\\\nMost of us (I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m guessing here) want to do our jobs well. Most of us\\\\n(still guessing) want more important jobs, bigger salaries, greater\\\\nsecurity, higher status, and a bright future. So we try to do our jobs\\\\nso well that we will be rewarded, respected, and promoted.\\\\n\\\\nAnd that is where we go wrong. (I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not guessing anymore.)\\\\n\\\\nOf course, we have to do our jobs really well. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no future for\\\\nthe screw-up, the bum, or the sociopath. But Richard Templar puts\\\\nhis finger on the flaw in the implied logic that concludes that the\\\\nbetter we do our job, the faster we will rise up the organization. He\\\\npoints out that we are all doing two jobs, but most of us are only\\\\nconscious of one of them\\xe2\\x80\\x94the job in hand: meeting our sales tar-\\\\ngets, reducing machine downtime, speeding up monthly\\\\nmanagement accounts, whatever. The other job is both larger and\\\\nvaguer: making the organization work. If people think you have it in\\\\nyou to solve the problems of the organization itself, not just your\\\\nsmall part of it, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve broken away from the pack. But how do you\\\\ndo that? There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an easy answer: read this book. Follow the Rules.\\\\n\\\\nI realized when I read this book that I have always been half con-\\\\nscious of the Rules, though I never managed to formulate and\\\\nanalyze them with the clarity and detail that Richard Templar brings\\\\nto the task. There was a time when I had to interview a lot of promo-\\\\ntion candidates in the BBC, and with most of them I had this feeling\\\\nthat somehow they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look like top management material. Was it\\\\nhow they dressed, how they walked, how they talked? Bits of all of\\\\nthose, but most of all their attitude, their frame of mind, which\\\\nsomehow affected all the others.\\\\n\\\\nMost of them stressed how well they did their present job, which\\\\nwas quite unnecessary. We knew that; that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why they were there. It\\\\nwas their entrance ticket to the interview, and there was no point in\\\\nconstantly waving it at us. Amazingly few of them had given any real\\\\nthought to the problems of the job they were applying for, as\\\\nopposed to the job they were doing, let alone the problems that\\\\n\\\\nviii T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nixFO R E W O R D\\\\n\\\\nfaced the BBC as an organization. They were oblivious of the Rules.\\\\n\\\\nThe American management guru Peter Drucker makes a useful dis-\\\\ntinction between efficiency and effectiveness: efficiency is doing the\\\\njob right, effectiveness is doing the right job. Your boss will tell you\\\\nhow to do the job right, but you have to work out for yourself what\\\\nthe right job is. It means looking at the world outside the organiza-\\\\ntion: what it needs, and how its needs are changing, and what the\\\\norganization must do (and stop doing) to survive and prosper.\\\\n\\\\nI remember interviewing two chief executives of great corporations.\\\\nBoth had joined from college with hundreds of other bright ambi-\\\\ntious graduates, and I asked them why it was they had gotten to the\\\\ntop of the heap and not any of the others. One said he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know,\\\\nbut what he could tell me was that every job he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d ever done was\\\\nabolished after he left it. The other didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know either, but said that\\\\nno job he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d ever done existed until he started doing it. Both of them\\\\nwere striking examples of people who focused on doing the right\\\\njob, of thinking like the chairman even when they were junior or\\\\nmiddle managers. And I have no doubt they followed all the other\\\\nrules as well, always somehow looking and sounding like someone\\\\nwho should be in a higher job. And as Richard Templar stresses\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\nthey were popular and respected throughout the organization. You\\\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a successful chief executive if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re surrounded by embit-\\\\ntered, resentful, and demoralized colleagues.\\\\n\\\\nThe Rules of Work is first and foremost a guide for the individual\\\\nmanager, an eye-opener for all those who would like to rise to the\\\\ntop but don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to be able to find the map. But it is also very\\\\nmuch a book for the organization itself; the great danger is fossiliza-\\\\ntion, becoming preoccupied with its internal tasks and systems and\\\\nprocedures, and losing touch with the world outside. And this will\\\\nhappen if everyone is concentrating on being efficient rather than\\\\nbeing effective\\xe2\\x80\\x94in other words, if they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t follow the Rules.\\\\n\\\\nSir Antony Jay \\\\nAuthor, Yes Minister and creator of Sir Humphrey \\\\n\\\\nFounder, Video Arts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nx T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nIntroduction\\\\nI first started formulating The Rules of Work many, many years\\\\nago when I was an assistant manager. There was a promotion\\\\ngoing for the next step up\\xe2\\x80\\x94manager. There were two possible\\\\ncandidates, myself and Rob. On paper I had more experience,\\\\nmore expertise, most of the staff wanted me as their manager,\\\\nand I generally knew the new job better. Rob, to be honest,\\\\nwas useless.\\\\n\\\\nI was chatting with an outside consultant the company used\\\\nand asked him what he thought my chances were. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSlim,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\\\nreplied. I was indignant. I explained all about my experience,\\\\nmy expertise, my superior abilities. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYep,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut you\\\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t walk like a manager.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd Rob does?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYep, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about\\\\nthe strength of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Needless to say he was quite right, and Rob\\\\ngot the job. I had to work under a moron. But a moron who\\\\nwalked right. I studied that walk very carefully.\\\\n\\\\nThe consultant was spot on\\xe2\\x80\\x94there was a manager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s walk. I\\\\nbegan to notice that every employee, every job, everyone in\\\\nfact, had their walk. Receptionists walked in a particular way,\\\\nas did the cashiers, the catering staff, the office workers, the\\\\nadmin, the security staff\\xe2\\x80\\x94and the managers, of course.\\\\nSecretly, I began to practice the walk.\\\\n\\\\nLooking the Part\\\\nAs I spent a lot of time watching the walk, I realized that there\\\\nwas also a manager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s style of attire, of speaking, of behavior. It\\\\nwasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enough that I was good at my job and had the experi-\\\\nence. I had to look as if I was better than anyone else. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\njust a walk\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was an entire makeover. And gradually, as I\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nxiI N T R O D U CT I O N\\\\n\\\\nwatched, I noticed that what newspaper was read was impor-\\\\ntant, as was what pen was used, how you wrote, how you\\\\ntalked to colleagues, what you said at meetings\\xe2\\x80\\x94everything,\\\\nin fact, was being judged, evaluated, acted upon. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\nenough to be able to do the job. If you wanted to get on, you\\\\nhad to be seen to be the Right Type. The Rules of Work is about\\\\ncreating that type\\xe2\\x80\\x94of course, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be able to do the\\\\njob in the first place. But a lot of people can do that. What\\\\nmakes you stand out? What makes you a suitable candidate\\\\nfor promotion? What makes the difference?\\\\n\\\\nAct One Step Ahead\\\\nI noticed that among the managers there were some who had\\\\nmastered the walk, but there were others who were practicing,\\\\nunconsciously, for the next walk\\xe2\\x80\\x94the general manager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s walk.\\\\n\\\\nI happened at that time to be travelling around a lot between\\\\ndifferent branches and noticed that among the general man-\\\\nagers there were some who were going to stay right where\\\\nthey were for a long time. But there were others already prac-\\\\nticing for their next step ahead\\xe2\\x80\\x94the regional director\\xe2\\x80\\x99s walk.\\\\nAnd style and image.\\\\n\\\\nI switched from practicing the manager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s walk and leapt ahead\\\\nto the general manager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s walk. Three months later I was pro-\\\\nmoted from assistant manager to general manager in one swift\\\\nmove. I was now the moron\\xe2\\x80\\x99s manager.\\\\n\\\\nWalk Your Talk\\\\nRob had the walk (Rule 18: Develop a Style That Gets You\\\\nNoticed), but unfortunately he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t adhere sufficiently to the\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nxii T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nnumber one rule\\xe2\\x80\\x94he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the job well enough. He\\\\nlooked right, sounded right, but the bottom line was\\xe2\\x80\\x94he\\\\ncouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do the job as well as he should have done. I was\\\\nbrought in over his head because they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sack him\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\nhaving just promoted him it would have looked bad\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\\\nthey needed someone to oversee his work so that his errors\\\\ncould be rectified quickly. Rob had reached the level of his\\\\nown incompetence and stayed there for several years neither\\\\nimproving nor particularly getting worse\\xe2\\x80\\x94just looking good\\\\nand walking right. He eventually shuffled himself off sideways\\\\ninto running his own business\\xe2\\x80\\x94a restaurant. This failed\\\\nshortly afterward because he forgot Rule 2: Never Stand Still\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\nor maybe he never actually knew it. He carried on walking like\\\\na manager instead of a restaurateur. His customers never really\\\\ntook to him.\\\\n\\\\nBy practicing the general manager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s walk, I got the promotion,\\\\nbut I also got it because I paid great attention to doing my job\\\\nwell\\xe2\\x80\\x94Rule 1. Once in this new job I was, of course, com-\\\\npletely out of my depth. I had to quickly learn not only my\\\\nnew role and all its responsibilities, but also the position\\\\nbelow, which I had not really held. I had stood in for managers\\\\nbut I had never been a manager\\xe2\\x80\\x94now I was the manager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\\\nmanager. I was in great danger of falling flat on my face.\\\\n\\\\nNever Let Anyone Know How Hard\\\\nYou Work\\\\nBut I was, by now, a dedicated Rules Player. There was only\\\\none recourse\\xe2\\x80\\x94secret learning. I spent every spare second\\\\navailable\\xe2\\x80\\x94evenings, weekends, lunch breaks\\xe2\\x80\\x94studying\\\\neverything I could that would help me. But I told no one\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\nRule 13.\\\\n\\\\nWithin a short time I had mastered enough to be able to do the\\\\njob well enough. And the embryonic Rules of Work were born.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nxiiiI N T R O D U CT I O N\\\\n\\\\nHave a Plan\\\\nBeing a general manager was both fun and pain. It was 50 per-\\\\ncent more work but only 20 percent more pay. My next step,\\\\nlogically, was regional director. But it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t appeal. More\\\\nwork\\xe2\\x80\\x94much more work but for not that much more money. I\\\\nbegan to develop a plan (Rules 24\\xe2\\x80\\x9334). Where did I want to go\\\\nnext? What did I want to do? I was getting bored being stuck\\\\nin the office all the time and all those endless dreary meetings.\\\\nAnd all that time spent at head office. Not for me. I wanted to\\\\nhave fun again. I wanted to practice the Rules. I formulated\\\\nmy plan.\\\\n\\\\nWhat the company didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have was a roving troubleshooter\\xe2\\x80\\x94a\\\\nsort of general manager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s general manager. I put Rule 4: Carve\\\\nOut a Niche for Yourself into play. I suggested to the chairman\\\\nthat a report was needed. I never suggested that this was the\\\\njob I wanted, but the agenda was obvious, I suppose. I got it,\\\\nof course, and became a peripatetic general manager, answer-\\\\nable directly only to the chairman and with a job description I\\\\nwrote myself. And pay? A lot more than the regional directors\\\\nwere on, but they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know and I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let on (Part V: Look\\\\nAfter Yourself). I cultivated their support and friendship; I was\\\\nnever a threat because it was obvious I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t after their job.\\\\nThey may have wanted the money I was making if they had\\\\nknown, but they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want the little niche I had carved out\\\\nfor myself.\\\\n\\\\nAnd I did this without being ruthless, dishonest, or unpleas-\\\\nant. In fact, I was always diplomatic when dealing with the\\\\ngeneral managers. I treated them with courtesy and politeness,\\\\neven when I had to confront them on some aspect of their job.\\\\nI added If you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say anything nice\\xe2\\x80\\x94shut up and learned the\\\\nrules in Part VIII: Cultivate Diplomacy.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nxiv T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nKnowing the People Who Count\\\\nAnd I quickly learned that if I wanted to know what was going\\\\non in a branch, it was best to speak to the people who really\\\\nknew\\xe2\\x80\\x94the maintenence staff, the receptionists, the cashiers,\\\\nthe elevator attendant, and the drivers. It was important both\\\\nto identify these people and to be on the right side of them\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\nRule 94. They supplied me with more information than anyone\\\\nwould have believed\\xe2\\x80\\x94and all for the price of a simple \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHello\\\\nBob, how\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your daughter doing at college these days?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe Rules of Work took shape. Over the next few years I\\\\nwatched them grow up and gain maturity and experience. I\\\\nleft the corporation and founded my own consultancy. I\\\\ntrained managers in The Rules of Work and watched them go\\\\nout into the world and conquer their destiny with charm and\\\\ncourtesy, confidence and authority.\\\\n\\\\nBut I see you have questions. How do these Rules work\\xe2\\x80\\x94are\\\\nthey manipulative? No, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make anyone else do any-\\\\nthing; it is you that is changing and improving.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Do I have to become someone else? No, you may need to\\\\nchange your behavior a bit, but not your personality or\\\\nvalues.You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go on being you, but a slicker, quicker you, a\\\\nmore successful you.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Are they hard to learn? No, you can learn them in a week\\\\nor two\\xe2\\x80\\x94but it does take a long time to really master\\\\nthem. But we are learning all the time and even practicing\\\\none Rule is better than none at all.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Is it easy to spot others doing them? Yes, sometimes, but\\\\nthe really good Rules Players will never let you see what\\\\nthey are doing; they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re too good for that. But once you\\\\nbecome a Rules Player too, it does become easier to see\\\\nwhat Rule people are using at any particular time.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nxvI N T R O D U CT I O N\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Will I notice benefits right away? Oh yes, you betcha\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\nimmediately.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Do I still do them? I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even admit to doing them\\\\nin the first place\\xe2\\x80\\x94I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a Rules Player after all.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Is it ethical to use the Rules? Yes. You aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t doing any-\\\\nthing wrong, merely utilizing your own natural skills and\\\\ntalents and adapting them, using them consciously. This\\\\nis a key area for understanding the Rules\\xe2\\x80\\x94consciously.\\\\nEverything you do will have been decided beforehand\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll still appear spontaneous, of course, you decided\\\\nthat as well\\xe2\\x80\\x94but you will be a conscious controller of\\\\nany situation rather than an unconscious victim. You will\\\\nbe awake and aware, living in the moment and taking\\\\nadvantage of your own abilities. The bottom line is that\\\\nyou must be able to do your job\\xe2\\x80\\x94and do it well in the\\\\nfirst place. The Rules are not for slackers. You think \\\\nyou work hard now? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing to doing the Rules \\\\nsuccessfully\\xe2\\x80\\x94now that really does take work.\\\\n\\\\nAnd let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face it, you love to work. You love doing your job.\\\\nYou have to, to be wanting to read the Rules and to want to be\\\\nmoving up. What I am suggesting is that you consciously\\\\nthink about every area of that work and make changes to\\\\nimprove\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The way you do it\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 How people perceive you to be doing it\\\\n\\\\nIf you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t practice the Rules, you will muddle along, get by,\\\\nmaybe find what it is you are looking for. You may already\\\\nknow a lot of these Rules\\xe2\\x80\\x94and be practicing them\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\ninstinctively and intuitively. Now we will do them consciously.\\\\nIf you do you will\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Get promoted \\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Get along better with your colleagues\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Feel better about yourself\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Enjoy your work more\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Understand your job better\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Understand your boss\\xe2\\x80\\x99s point of view better\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Take more pride in both yourself and your work\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Set a good example for junior staff\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Contribute more to your company\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Be valued and respected\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Spread an aura of goodwill and cooperation around you\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Be successful if you leave to start your own business.\\\\n\\\\nThese Rules are simple and effective, safe and practical. They\\\\nare your 10 steps to building confidence and creating a new\\\\nand more powerful you. And building that new you morally\\\\nand ethically. You aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to do anything that you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\nexpect\\xe2\\x80\\x94and appreciate\\xe2\\x80\\x94others doing to you. These Rules\\\\nenhance personal standards and elevate your individual princi-\\\\nples. They are my gift to you. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re yours. Keep them safe,\\\\nkeep them secret.\\\\n\\\\nxvi T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPART I\\\\n\\\\nWALK YOUR\\\\nTALK\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis page intentionally left blank \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThese first Rules are the underlying ones that govern all the\\\\nothers\\xe2\\x80\\x94know your job well, do it well, and be better than\\\\nanyone else at doing it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that simple. The secret part is to\\\\nmake sure nobody knows how hard you have to work to do it\\\\nso well. You can do all your learning in secret, in private\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let on, and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let anyone know you do this\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\\\nnever ever let anyone know you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve read this book; it is your\\\\nsecret bible. The important thing is to look calm and efficient,\\\\non top of everything and totally in control. You glide through\\\\nyour daily work with ease and confidence. You are unflappable\\\\nand unstoppable. Bottom line is, however, you must be really\\\\ngood at your basic job.\\\\n\\\\n3W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all too easy for your work to get overlooked in the busy\\\\nhurly-burly of office life. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re slaving away, and it can be\\\\nhard to remember that you need to put in some effort to boost\\\\nyour individual status and personal kudos for your work. But\\\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important. You have to make your mark so you stand out\\\\nand your promotional potential will be realized.\\\\n\\\\nThe best way to do this is to step outside the normal working\\\\nroutine. If you have to process so many widgets each day\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\nand so does everyone else\\xe2\\x80\\x94then processing more won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do\\\\nyou that much good. But if you submit a report to your boss of\\\\nhow everyone could process more widgets, then you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get\\\\nnoticed. The unsolicited report is a brilliant way to stand out\\\\nfrom the crowd. It shows you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re thinking on your feet and\\\\nusing your initiative. But it mustn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be used too often. If you\\\\nsubject your boss to a barrage of unsolicited reports, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get\\\\nnoticed but in completely the wrong way. You have to stick to\\\\ncertain Rules:\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Only submit a report occasionally.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Make really sure that your report will actually work\\xe2\\x80\\x94that it\\\\nwill do good or provide benefits.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Make sure your name is prominently displayed.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Make sure the report will be seen not only by your boss,\\\\nbut by his boss as well.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to be a report\\xe2\\x80\\x94it can be an article in the\\\\ncompany newsletter.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 1\\\\n\\\\n4 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nGet Your Work Noticed\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOf course, the very best way to get your work noticed is to be\\\\nvery, very good at your job. And the best way to be good at\\\\nyour job is to be totally dedicated to doing the job and ignor-\\\\ning all the rest. There is a vast amount of politics, gossip,\\\\ngamesmanship, time wasting, and socializing that goes on in\\\\nthe name of work. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. Keep your eye on the ball, and\\\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll already be playing with a vast advantage over your col-\\\\nleagues. The Rules Player stays focused. Keep your mind on\\\\nthe task at hand\\xe2\\x80\\x94being very good at your job\\xe2\\x80\\x94and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get\\\\ndistracted.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 1\\\\n\\\\n5W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\\\n\\\\nTHE UNSOLICITED REPORT\\\\n\\\\nIS A BRILLIANT WAY TO\\\\n\\\\nSTAND OUT FROM \\\\n\\\\nTHE CROWD.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNever Stand Still\\\\n\\\\nRULE 2\\\\n\\\\n6 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nMost people go into work each day with only one thought\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\ngetting through to going home time. During their day they\\\\nwill do whatever they have to, to arrive at that magic time. You\\\\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. You won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stand still. Having gotten the job seems\\\\nenough for most people that they will just do it and thus\\\\nremain static. But doing the job isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the end game for you\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\\\nis merely a means to the end. And the end for you is promo-\\\\ntion, more money, success, amassing the contacts and\\\\nexperience to set out on your own, whatever it is that is on\\\\nyour wish list. The job, in a way, is an irrelevance.\\\\n\\\\nYes, you have to do the work. And yes, you have to do it\\\\nsupremely well. But your eye should already be on the next\\\\nstep, and every activity you indulge in at work should be\\\\nmerely a step in your plan to move up.\\\\n\\\\nWhile others are thinking of their next coffee break or how to\\\\nget through the afternoon without actually having to do any\\\\nwork, you will be busy planning and executing your next\\\\nmaneuver. In an ideal world, the Rules Players will have\\\\ngotten their work done by lunchtime so that they have the\\\\nafternoon free to study for the next promotion, to assess the\\\\ncompetition among close colleagues, to write the unsolicited\\\\nreports to get their work noticed, to research ways to improve\\\\nthe work process for everyone, to further their knowledge of\\\\ncompany procedures and history.\\\\n\\\\nIf you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get your work done by lunchtime, then you will\\\\nhave to fit all these things into and around the work. What the\\\\ncompetition will be doing is not doing them. But you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\nstand still. Never accept that doing the job is enough. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nfor the others. You will be moving right along preparing,\\\\nstudying, analyzing, and learning.\\\\n\\\\nWe talked earlier about the manager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s walk; well, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be doing, practicing the manager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s walk\\xe2\\x80\\x94or whoever\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\\\nwalk it is you need to master. You have to see promotion\\xe2\\x80\\x94or\\\\nwhatever else it is you want\\xe2\\x80\\x94as a movement. You keep\\\\nmoving or you grow moss. You have to have movement or you\\\\ngrow stagnant. You have to like movement or you grow roots.\\\\n\\\\nMovement requires of you that you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sit on your backside\\\\nand do nothing\\xe2\\x80\\x94don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stand still.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 2\\\\n\\\\n7W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\\\n\\\\nIN AN IDEAL WORLD, THE\\\\n\\\\nRULES PLAYERS WILL\\\\n\\\\nHAVE GOTTEN THEIR WORK\\\\n\\\\nDONE BY LUNCHTIME SO\\\\n\\\\nTHAT THEY HAVE THE\\\\n\\\\nAFTERNOON FREE.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVolunteer Carefully\\\\n\\\\nRULE 3\\\\n\\\\n8 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nA lot of people think that if they say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to everything, they\\\\nwill get noticed, get praised, and get promoted. Not true. The\\\\nclever manager above them will use this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do it\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mentality,\\\\nand you will end up overworked, undervalued, and abused.\\\\nBefore you put your hand up to volunteer for anything, think\\\\nvery carefully. You have to ask yourself various questions:\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Why is this person asking for volunteers?\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 How will this further my plan?\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 How will I look to senior management if I volunteer?\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 How will I look if I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t volunteer?\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Is this a dirty job that no one else wants?\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Or is this person genuinely, desperately overburdened and\\\\nreally in need of my help?\\\\n\\\\nIt might well be a dirty job that no one else wants, and by vol-\\\\nunteering you might look very good in the eyes of senior\\\\nmanagement\\xe2\\x80\\x94they think you capable of rising to a challenge,\\\\nbeing useful, and being prepared to get your sleeves rolled up\\\\nand stuck in. On the other hand, they might think you are an\\\\nidiot. Or if you volunteer to do the filing, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see you as a\\\\nmere filing clerk. Or you might generate a load of goodwill for\\\\nhelping out someone in real need of support. Be careful and\\\\nchoose your moments. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no point sticking your hand up\\\\nif it means you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be seen as a monkey. Only take that\\\\none step forward when you are confident you will look good,\\\\ngain benefit, or make a difference to someone who needs help.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlso be aware that sometimes you seem to have volunteered\\\\nwithout putting your hand up or stepping forward. It just hap-\\\\npens that sometimes all your colleagues take a collective step\\\\nbackward, leaving you there out in the open seemingly volun-\\\\nteering when you really had no intention of doing so. The first\\\\ntime this happens, you will have to ride with it and do the\\\\njob\\xe2\\x80\\x94but make sure it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen again\\xe2\\x80\\x94not to a Rules\\\\nPlayer, not twice. Keep your ear better attuned next time and\\\\nfeel out the collective approach. Make sure you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re stepping\\\\nbackward with the rest of them.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 3\\\\n\\\\n9W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\\\n\\\\nBEFORE YOU PUT YOUR\\\\n\\\\nHAND UP TO VOLUNTEER\\\\n\\\\nFOR ANYTHING,  THINK\\\\n\\\\nVERY CAREFULLY.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCarve Out a Niche for Yourself\\\\n\\\\nRULE 4\\\\n\\\\n10 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nI once worked with a colleague who made it a great personal\\\\nskill to find out stuff about customers that we couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. It\\\\nseemed he always knew the names of their children, where\\\\nthey went on vacation, their birthdays\\xe2\\x80\\x94and their spouses\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\ntheir favorite music and restaurants. Consequently, if you had\\\\nto deal with a particular customer you went to Mike and\\\\nasked, politely and humbly, if he could give you some little\\\\ntitbit that would get you well in with the customer. Mike had\\\\ncarved out a niche for himself. No one asked him to become a\\\\nwalking encyclopedia of customer likes and dislikes. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\npart of his job description. It took a lot of work and unseen\\\\neffort. And it was a very valuable asset. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take long for\\\\nthe regional director to hear of this extra effort Mike had put\\\\nin, and his rise up the corporate ladder was swift, meteoric,\\\\nunprecedented. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all it took. I say \\xe2\\x80\\x9call,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but it was in fact a\\\\nlot of work and immensely clever.\\\\n\\\\nCarving out a niche means spotting a useful area that no one\\\\nelse has spotted. It might be as simple as being great at spread-\\\\nsheets or report writing. It might be, like Mike, knowing\\\\nsomething no one else does. It might be being brilliant with\\\\ncompany software or budgets or understanding the system.\\\\nMake sure you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make yourself indispensable, or this rule\\\\nbackfires.\\\\n\\\\nCarving out a niche for yourself often takes you out of the\\\\nnormal range of office activities. You get to move around\\\\nmore, be out of the office more often without having to\\\\nexplain to anyone where you are or what you are doing. This\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nmakes you stand out from the herd and gives you independ-\\\\nence and a superior quality. I once volunteered to edit the\\\\ncompany newsletter\\xe2\\x80\\x94bearing in mind the previous rule\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\\\ncould wander about between our seven branches at will.\\\\nObviously, I always made sure my work was done on time and\\\\nsupremely well.\\\\n\\\\nCarving out a niche for yourself frequently means you get\\\\nnoticed by people other than your boss\\xe2\\x80\\x94other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\\\nbosses. These bosses get together and they talk. If they bring\\\\nyour name up it will be in a good way\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see Rich has been\\\\nbusy doing some really original market analysis.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This makes\\\\nit difficult for your boss not to promote you if she wants to\\\\nwin her peer group approval. If the other bosses think you are\\\\na good idea, then your boss really has to go along with it.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 4\\\\n\\\\n11W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\\\n\\\\nIF  THE OTHER BOSSES\\\\n\\\\nTHINK YOU ARE A GOOD\\\\n\\\\nIDEA,  THEN YOUR BOSS\\\\n\\\\nREALLY HAS TO GO ALONG\\\\n\\\\nWITH IT.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUnder Promise and Over Deliver\\\\n\\\\nRULE 5\\\\n\\\\n12 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nIf you know you can do it by Wednesday, always say Friday. If\\\\nyou know it will take your department a week, say two. If you\\\\nknow it will cost an extra two people to get the new machine\\\\ninstalled and up and running, then say three.\\\\n\\\\nThis isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dishonest, merely prudent. If it gets spotted that this\\\\nis what you do, then openly and honestly admit it and say you\\\\nalways build a contingency percentage into your calculations.\\\\nThey can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t kill you for that.\\\\n\\\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the first bit. Under promise. And just because you have\\\\nsaid Friday or two weeks or whatever doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean you can\\\\ncoast and use up that allowance. Oh, no. What you have to do\\\\nis make sure you deliver early, on budget, and better than\\\\npromised. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the second part. Over deliver. This means\\\\nif you promised to have the report finished by Monday first\\\\nthing, it is finished, but not only is it a report it also contains\\\\nthe full implementation plans for the new premises. Or if you\\\\nsaid you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have the exhibition stand up and running by\\\\nSunday night with only two extra members of staff, you\\\\nhave\\xe2\\x80\\x94and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve managed to get your major competitor to\\\\npull out of the show. Or if you said you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have a rough pro-\\\\nposal written for the new company brochure by the next\\\\nmeeting, you not only have this but also a full color mock-up,\\\\nthe complete text written and proofread, all the photos taken,\\\\nand full printing costs and quotes for distribution. Obviously,\\\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be careful that you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t overstep the mark and\\\\nassume responsibilities you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been given, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure\\\\nyou get the idea.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAgain, it might be stating the obvious, but don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be too blatant\\\\nwhen you do this or your boss will get to expect it\\xe2\\x80\\x94it should\\\\nbe a pleasant surprise, not a frequently used tactic.\\\\n\\\\nIt also helps sometimes to act dumb. You can pretend you\\\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really understand some new technique or software when\\\\nin reality you know it back to front. Then when you suddenly\\\\ndo all the budgets on the spreadsheets that no one else could,\\\\nyou look good. If, in advance, you had said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, I know\\\\nthat, I worked with these spreadsheets at my last place,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d there\\\\nis no surprise, and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve given the game away\\xe2\\x80\\x94and your\\\\nadvantage.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you under promise and over deliver, you have to have a\\\\nbottom line\\xe2\\x80\\x94in your case, as a Rules Player, it is simply that\\\\nyou will never deliver late or deliver short. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it. If you\\\\nhave to sweat blood and work all night, then so be it. You will\\\\ndeliver when you said you would\\xe2\\x80\\x94or earlier if you can\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\nwithout exception. It is better to negotiate a longer delivery\\\\ntime in the first place than to have to let someone down. A lot\\\\nof people are so keen to be liked, or approved of, or praised\\\\nthat they will agree to the first delivery time offered to them\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes, I can do that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and then they fail. They look like\\\\npushovers in the first place and incompetent in the last.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 5\\\\n\\\\n13W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\\\n\\\\nYOU WILL NEVER DELIVER\\\\n\\\\nLATE OR DELIVER SHORT.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLearn to Ask Why\\\\n\\\\nRULE 6\\\\n\\\\n14 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nYou won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to do your best for your employer if you\\\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see the big picture. You may be only a humble cog in a\\\\nhuge grinding machine, but if you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t step back and see\\\\nwhat the whole machine is up to, you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to do your\\\\nlittle coggy things as well as you could. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more, if you\\\\nonly ever talk in terms of your cog and your immediate neigh-\\\\nboring cogs and bolts and shafts and pistons, everyone around\\\\nyou will see you as belonging neatly in that little part of the\\\\nmachine.\\\\n\\\\nBut you have aspirations to move into bigger and more impor-\\\\ntant parts of the machine, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you? Of course you\\\\ndo\\xe2\\x80\\x94you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a Rules Player. You want to grow and develop and\\\\nmake a bigger contribution. And to do that\\xe2\\x80\\x94and be seen as a\\\\nsuitable candidate to do that\\xe2\\x80\\x94you need to understand what\\\\ndrives the whole thing and what its purpose is.\\\\n\\\\nThe way you do that is to ask questions. When your boss\\\\nbriefs you on any new task or project, ask how it fits into the\\\\nbig picture. Why are you shifting focus to selling by phone? Is\\\\nthis a standard market trend, or is your company trying to do\\\\nsomething innovative? Why is the accounts department split-\\\\nting into two\\xe2\\x80\\x94is this to benefit customers or to help the\\\\ninternal structure?

They can coast;\\\\nyou can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. They can afford to lighten up and put their feet up;\\\\nyou can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. To move up, you have to be 100 percent committed.\\\\nYou can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford to lose sight of your long-term goal for a\\\\nsecond. For you there is no time off, no downtime, no loung-\\\\ning around time, no slipups, no mistakes, no accidental\\\\ndeviations from the script. \\\\n\\\\nYou have to become like a master criminal\\xe2\\x80\\x94they lead incredi-\\\\nbly law-abiding lives because they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t risk breaking a tiny\\\\nlaw in case it draws attention to themselves and the really big\\\\ncrimes get revealed\\xe2\\x80\\x94and watch what you say and what you\\\\ndo.\\\\n\\\\nIf any of this seems too much, then bow out now. I only want\\\\ncommitted Rules Players on this team. You are going to have\\\\nto sign an oath in blood if you want to make this grade. You\\\\nare going to have to be vigilant, dedicated, watchful, keen,\\\\nready, prepared, cautious, alert, and on the ball. Tall order.\\\\n\\\\nIs it worth it? You bet. In the land of the blind, you will be the\\\\nonly one with both eyes open and seeing. You will be power-\\\\nful\\xe2\\x80\\x94and most importantly you will be having fun. There is no\\\\ngreater buzz than seeing the games that are going on around\\\\nyou and being completely uninvolved, utterly objective, and\\\\nsupremely detached.\\\\n\\\\nYou will find that you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to do very much once you\\\\nstart observing. You will be able to give people a tiny nudge to\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nget them to change direction rather than a huge big shove.\\\\nYour dealings will become incredibly delicate and gentle. \\\\n\\\\nBut you really do have to be 100 percent committed. If you try\\\\nthis stuff without such dedication, you will go off half-cocked\\\\nand run the risk of looking foolish instead of cool and in con-\\\\ntrol. But the beauty of total commitment is that you no longer\\\\nhave any decisions to make. You know your path exactly and\\\\nin any situation you only have to ask, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoes this further my\\\\nRule playing or not?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94and then the decision is made for you.\\\\nEasy.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 7\\\\n\\\\n17W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\\\n\\\\nYOU ARE GOING TO HAVE\\\\n\\\\nTO BE VIGILANT,\\\\n\\\\nDEDICATED,  WATCHFUL,\\\\n\\\\nKEEN, READY,  PREPARED,\\\\n\\\\nCAUTIOUS,  ALERT,  AND \\\\n\\\\nON THE BALL.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLearn from Others\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Mistakes\\\\n\\\\nRULE 8\\\\n\\\\n18 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nA clever man learns from his own mistakes, but a wise man\\\\nlearns from others\\xe2\\x80\\x99 mistakes. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what they say, and any\\\\nRules Player with sense follows this principle. We all make\\\\nsome mistakes, but the fewer you make the better.\\\\n\\\\nIt sounds good, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it? However, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just have the\\\\nodd catchy quote up your sleeve. You have to really do this\\\\nstuff. That means that every time someone near you messes\\\\nup, you need to know all about it. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to do your\\\\ndetective work, subtly mind you. No one wants to be cross-\\\\nexamined by a colleague about where they went wrong, and\\\\nthere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a danger of coming across as smug and self-satisfied\\\\nand nosy and condescending because it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you who made\\\\nthe mistake, and that is definitely non-Rules behavior.\\\\n\\\\nSo when a colleague gets himself in hot water, find out what\\\\nwent wrong without getting spotted. One of the best ways to\\\\ndo this is to offer to help him put things right. After all, this\\\\nisn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a competition, and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually want our teammates\\\\nto mess up. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just that if they do it anyway, we might as well\\\\nget some benefit from it. Helping them remedy things can be a\\\\ngreat way of finding out exactly what happened.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve found out just what went wrong, work out how\\\\nand why it happened. Then be brutally honest with yourself\\\\nabout whether you could have made the same mistake. Have\\\\nyou ever been in a hurry and failed to double-check the paper-\\\\nwork? Or forgotten to check your voice mail at the end of the\\\\nday? Or negotiated on the basis of figures you took as right\\\\nbut could actually have been inaccurate? Or written down the\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nwrong delivery date in your diary? If so, you need to devise\\\\nsome kind of system now to make sure it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen in the\\\\nfuture; otherwise it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only a matter of time before you make\\\\nthe same mistake. And remember, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already witnessed\\\\nyour colleague getting it wrong, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll look even worse when\\\\nit subsequently happens to you.\\\\n\\\\nOver time, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find that a thorough and inquiring attitude\\\\nto other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mistakes, rather than a complacent, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\nhappen to me\\xe2\\x80\\x9d approach, will more than pay off. And the\\\\nfewer mistakes you make, the more you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll impress the boss.

If there is\\\\nno entertainment value in your work, then there really is no\\\\npoint in doing it\\xe2\\x80\\x94you can probably get enough in unemploy-\\\\nment benefit to survive. I think there are an awful lot of\\\\npeople out there who really do enjoy working but are fright-\\\\nened to say so in case they get accused of being workaholics or\\\\nsad or something. \\\\n\\\\nThere is no shame in saying you enjoy your work. There\\\\nseems to be some kudos in being miserable at work, in moan-\\\\ning about your situation. There is a sort of office pecking order\\\\nwhere people try to outdo each other in moaning about how\\\\nmuch they hate their work.\\\\n\\\\nNot for you there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not. The Rules Player enjoys work and\\\\nmakes sure people know that. Once you acknowledge that\\\\nwork is fun\\xe2\\x80\\x94and for you it is even more fun than for anyone\\\\nelse\\xe2\\x80\\x94you will find your step lightens, your stress levels\\\\ndecrease, and your whole demeanor lightens. By admitting\\\\nwork is fun, you are trading in a secret bit of knowledge that\\\\nonly really successful people usually have. Work is fun\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\nengrave it on your heart.\\\\n\\\\nHaving a good time at work and realizing work is good isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\nthe same thing. Work being good means you take pride in\\\\nwhat you do, enjoy the challenge, and look forward to each\\\\nday with optimism and enthusiasm. Having a good time at\\\\nwork means not achieving much, talking a lot, winding up\\\\ncolleagues, and drinking champagne all afternoon. There is a\\\\ndifference, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure you will agree. Having a good time at work\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nis a temporary thing. It lasts while the fun lasts but quickly\\\\nflags once the excitement, the elation, has worn off. \\\\n\\\\nWork being good means enjoying the negotiating, the hiring\\\\nand firing, the day-to-day challenges, the stresses and disap-\\\\npointments, the uncertain future, the testing of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mettle,\\\\nthe new learning curves. A surprising number of people die\\\\nwithin a year of retirement\\xe2\\x80\\x94this suggests that work is more\\\\nimportant to our existence than we think.\\\\n\\\\nIf you ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enjoying all this and appreciating that it is enjoy-\\\\nable, then you are doomed to be one of the moaners, one of\\\\nlife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s victims. \\\\n\\\\nRULE 9\\\\n\\\\n21W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\\\n\\\\nTHERE IS NO SHAME IN\\\\n\\\\nSAYING YOU ENJOY \\\\n\\\\nYOUR WORK.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDevelop the Right Attitude\\\\n\\\\nRULE 10\\\\n\\\\n22 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nAt work a lot of people have a sort of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cus and them\\xe2\\x80\\x9d attitude.\\\\nThey like to side with the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cworkers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and moan about the\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmanagement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d You, on the other hand, will develop the right\\\\nattitude and not become one of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cus\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mentality. No matter\\\\nwhat your position now, you are the next head of department,\\\\nan embryonic chairman of the board, a budding managing\\\\ndirector. You have to start to look at both sides of a situation\\\\nand identify the position of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthem.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d You may not voice this\\\\nand may even, in public, appear to side with your fellow\\\\nworkers and colleagues. But deep down, in your heart, you\\\\nunderstand and side with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthem.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Never forget that. Your col-\\\\nleagues may moan about management policy, but you will\\\\nanalyze it and try to see it from their point of view. To fit in\\\\nand blend you may be tempted to adopt the camouflage of a\\\\nmoaning worker\\xe2\\x80\\x94not a wise move. Nod in agreement, but\\\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t moan yourself.\\\\n\\\\nThe right attitude is twofold:\\\\n\\\\n1. You side with management and see policy decision from\\\\ntheir point of view.\\\\n\\\\n2. You devote your attention to becoming a total and com-\\\\nmitted Rules Player\\xe2\\x80\\x94you look out for Number One\\\\n(that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s you).\\\\n\\\\nThe right attitude means giving it your best shot, not just\\\\ntoday but every day. Not just when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy but when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s awful\\\\nas well. \\\\n\\\\nThe right attitude means going that extra mile, giving it that\\\\nextra effort even when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re tired and pissed off and ready to\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nquit. Others can quit, but you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a Rules Player.\\\\n\\\\nThe right attitude is head up, never moaning, always positive\\\\nand upbeat, constantly looking for the advantage and the\\\\nedge.\\\\n\\\\nThe right attitude is developing standards\\xe2\\x80\\x94and sticking to\\\\nthem. Being sure of your bottom line and knowing when to\\\\nmake a stand. The right attitude is being aware that you have\\\\nenormous power and that you will exercise that power with\\\\nkindness, restraint, humanity, and consideration. You won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\nput anyone down or be ruthless or manipulative. Yes, you may\\\\ntake advantage of others\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sleepiness or apathy or wrong atti-\\\\ntude\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s their problem. But you will take the moral high\\\\nground and be blameless.

Whether your\\\\njob satisfaction comes from the people you work with, the\\\\nsense of achievement, a deep belief in what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing, the\\\\nrecognition you get, the money you earn, or anything else\\xe2\\x80\\x94I\\\\nhope you get enough out of the job to feel very passionate\\\\nabout doing it.\\\\n\\\\nBut don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fall into the trap of thinking that if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re passionate\\\\nyou have to work long hours and jump through countless\\\\nhoops to prove it. Being passionate isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the same thing as\\\\nstaying late at the office. If you have a positive sense of belief\\\\nin your work and an enthusiasm for it, that will shine\\\\nthrough. Your boss will recognize it and, I trust, appreciate it,\\\\nregardless of the hours you put in.\\\\n\\\\nIt isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessary to work yourself into the ground to be pas-\\\\nsionate about your work. In fact, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to sustain your love\\\\nof a job that is slowly draining all your energy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you\\\\nachieve that counts, not how long it takes you to achieve it.\\\\nYou might argue that if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re really passionate you should be\\\\nable to achieve the same as other people in a fraction of the\\\\ntime. OK, that may not mean you can go home by mid-after-\\\\nnoon, but it does mean that your passion will keep your\\\\noutput high even if you knock off at 5:30 like everyone else.\\\\n\\\\nBeing passionate about your work, which is generally regarded\\\\nas being a Good Thing, is about caring whether you do a good\\\\njob. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not about how you work; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about how you feel. So\\\\nnot only do you not have to work long hours to prove your\\\\npassion, but it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t prove it anyway because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quite pos-\\\\nsible to work 16 hours a day and still not care about what you\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ndo. It would be a pretty miserable life, granted, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve known\\\\npeople do it.\\\\n\\\\nSo cultivate a positive enthusiasm about your work. If you\\\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel passionate about it, look for a new way to view it\\\\nthat makes you care, or work out what would generate that\\\\nkind of passion in you, and then create it in your work. Now,\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not saying it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy. For some people it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lifelong search.\\\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll promise you one thing\\xe2\\x80\\x94if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not even looking,\\\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never find it.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 11\\\\n\\\\n25W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\\\n\\\\nIT \\xe2\\x80\\x99S NOT ABOUT HOW \\\\n\\\\nYOU WORK; IT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S ABOUT\\\\n\\\\nHOW YOU FEEL.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nManage Your Energy\\\\n\\\\nRULE 12\\\\n\\\\n26 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nHave you heard of time management? Of course you have.\\\\nEveryone has. I hope you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re good at it and doing everything\\\\nyou can to improve. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always room to manage our time\\\\nbetter, and the more effectively you work, the more you will\\\\nachieve and the more time you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have left over for yourself as\\\\nwell.\\\\n\\\\nWhat gets less well promoted is the need to manage your\\\\nenergy. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why this is, since your energy is one of\\\\nyour most essential resources and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look after itself.\\\\nYou need to bring plenty of energy to what you do at work,\\\\nand it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your job to make sure that energy is there when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\\\nneeded.\\\\n\\\\nIn part this means looking after your physical energy. Make\\\\nsure you stay fit and healthy, and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wear yourself out when\\\\nyou have work the next day. Just as we make the kids go to\\\\nbed on time when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s school tomorrow, so you should make\\\\nsure you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stay up late, overeat, get drunk, wear yourself\\\\nout, skip breakfast, or otherwise reduce your potential at\\\\nwork.\\\\n\\\\nAnd don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget your mental energy. What time of day do you\\\\nwork best? On a full stomach or just a comfortable one with\\\\nno hunger pains? What environment makes you most effective\\\\nat work\\xe2\\x80\\x94quiet, busy, pressured, noisy, companionable? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\\\nall different, and you may not have total control over your\\\\nworking day, but you can make sure those tasks that need con-\\\\ncentration get allocated to times when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re best able to\\\\nconcentrate and so on.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnd there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emotional energy too. If things are going badly in\\\\nyour home life, you need to find ways to bolster your emo-\\\\ntional mood before you get to work in the morning so your\\\\njob isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t affected (there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more on this in Rule 14: Keep Your\\\\nHome Life at Home). If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re under emotional pressure at\\\\nwork, again, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to come up with constructive ways to\\\\nkeep your energy levels up\\xe2\\x80\\x94go for a run at lunchtime, tackle\\\\nthe person who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bugging you, talk to your boss about your\\\\nworries.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, your spiritual side needs room to stretch to feel ener-\\\\ngized. For some people this can happen outside work, while\\\\nothers need to be doing a job that gives them a strong sense of\\\\nmoral worth. Only you know where you stand on this, but\\\\nmake sure that your job isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cramping your spiritual energy,\\\\nor in the end both you and the job will suffer.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 12\\\\n\\\\n27W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\\\n\\\\nIT \\xe2\\x80\\x99S YOUR JOB TO MAKE\\\\n\\\\nSURE THAT ENERGY IS\\\\n\\\\nTHERE WHEN IT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S NEEDED.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNever Let Anyone Know How\\\\nHard You Work\\\\n\\\\nRULE 13\\\\n\\\\n28 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nLook at someone like Richard Branson.

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a\\\\nneat image and one that he seems very happy to go along\\\\nwith\\xe2\\x80\\x94and why not?\\\\n\\\\nThis is the sort of image the intrepid Rules Player wants to\\\\ncultivate\\xe2\\x80\\x94suave, easy, relaxed, languid, in control, and very\\\\nchilled. You never run, never panic, never even seem to hurry.\\\\nYes, you may stay up until the early hours of every morning,\\\\nbut you will never admit this. Yes, you may work through\\\\nyour vacations, weekends, and days off, but you will never let\\\\non, never moan about how hard you work or the hours you\\\\nput in. To the outside observer you are coasting, taking it easy,\\\\ntaking it all in your stride.\\\\n\\\\nObviously, to be able to do this you have to be very good at\\\\nyour job. If you ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, then you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to fail trying this Rule\\\\nout for size. So, what do you do if you aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t very good at your\\\\njob?

But you do\\\\nhave to keep your personal life well in the background and\\\\nconcentrate on your job during working hours.

Smile no matter what. Smile when you greet\\\\nyour colleagues in the morning. Smile when you shake hands.\\\\nSmile when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting tough. Smile when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hell. Smile no\\\\nmatter what. \\\\n\\\\nAnd what sort of smile? Friendly, genuine\\xe2\\x80\\x94make sure it\\\\nextends to your eyes\\xe2\\x80\\x94sincere, frank, honest, open, happy.\\\\nAnd the easiest way to make your smile all these things is to\\\\nbelieve them all. This can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be an act or it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be spotted immedi-\\\\nately. It has to be genuine to appear genuine. You have to feel\\\\nhappy. You have to be enjoying this or your smile will look\\\\ninsincere and false. And if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not enjoying this, then stop\\\\npretending with a fake smile and get the hell out.\\\\n\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll assume your smile is real and that it comes from genuine\\\\nhappiness and friendliness. Now it is legit to improve on your\\\\nsmile, to rehearse it, to make it better. But it has to be there in\\\\nthe first place. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll assume it is.\\\\n\\\\nLook in the mirror and smile. Chances are it will look all\\\\nwrong. Of course it will. You can only see yourself front on.\\\\nAnd photos don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work either, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in 2D and there is a lot\\\\nmissing when you look at them. You need to see your smile\\\\nfrom all angles, in 3D, and there is only one way to see this\\\\nand that is on film\\xe2\\x80\\x94video or whatever.\\\\n\\\\nIf you feel embarrassed getting a partner or friend to video you\\\\nso you can improve your smile, then you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to set it up\\\\nyourself. Please don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make the mistake I once made. I was a\\\\n\\\\nCultivate a Smile\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nfinance manager and was asked to cover for one of our super-\\\\nmarket managers for an afternoon. The store was empty, and I\\\\nspent a most enjoyable afternoon practicing my walk, my\\\\nsmile, my general appearance on the CCTV system in the\\\\nstore. I would go back to the office and watch the results as I\\\\nchanged a slight part of whatever bit I was unhappy with. It\\\\nwas great fun. A few weeks later I was invited to watch a spe-\\\\ncial show for all the staff. Yes, I had forgotten to wipe the tape\\\\nand the shop manager\\xe2\\x80\\x94bless him\\xe2\\x80\\x94had found it and had\\\\nbeen putting on shows for all the general staff. I was forced to\\\\nsit through the whole thing while my coworkers commented\\\\non it and pointed out where I was going wrong. Very droll,\\\\nvery funny.\\\\n\\\\nSo to improve your smile, make sure you aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t doing a lop-\\\\nsided grin, that your teeth can be seen but not too much, that\\\\nyou look happy and honest.

How\\\\nmany times do you have to shake hands during a normal busi-\\\\nness week? And how much thought do you give to it? There\\\\nare so many signals given during that brief handshake though,\\\\nthat you really ought to make it supremely confident, utterly\\\\nsecure, and convincingly reassuring. When someone shakes\\\\nhands with you, he should be left with the impression of\\\\nstrength, confidence, power, and of someone totally in control\\\\nof himself\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s you, of course. If you are in any doubt about\\\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9crightness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of your handshake, get a friend to tell you.\\\\n\\\\nHow do you make it better? Make it firm. You can always use\\\\nthe other hand to reassuringly grip both your hand and that of\\\\nyour boss/colleague/client. But don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t overdo it and leave this\\\\nperson with crushed fingers. \\\\n\\\\nYou can always adapt your handshake to make it more indi-\\\\nvidual, more memorable. My grandfather had a wonderful\\\\nhandshake. He just used his first two fingers (the fore and\\\\nindex) and his thumb and gripped very firmly. You felt as if\\\\nyou were shaking hands with royalty.\\\\n\\\\nHandshakes are very formal, old-fashioned things. Forget\\\\nabout the high fives, the Masonic twitches, or anything\\\\ngangsta-style. Stick to the old-fashioned sort of shake and you\\\\nwill be remembered as someone confident and authoritative.\\\\n\\\\nGood shakers are the ones who proffer their hand first as well\\\\nas shaking well. They exude confidence by announcing their\\\\nname and offering their hand at the same time thus showing\\\\nkeenness, friendliness, a relaxed and confident approach, and\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\na general air of assertiveness. They also look you in the eyes\\\\nand say your name back to you. We like hearing our own\\\\nname, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an aide memoire.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you do announce your name, the word that goes first is\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHello.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it.

But the good Rules Player says\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHello.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And follows that with her name. And your name is\\\\nalso formal and old fashioned. It is never \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHi, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Dave, from\\\\nMarketing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The effect is pleasant enough and certainly\\\\nfriendly, but you will have impressed no one, gained no bene-\\\\nfit or advantage, and brought yourself down to just about the\\\\nlevel of the most junior person there. Much better to say,\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHello, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m David Simpson, Marketing Manager.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This imme-\\\\ndiately separates you from the herd and makes you more\\\\nsenior to anyone else there.

As I walked to the front to start my\\\\ntalk, I noticed that there was no lectern for notes (not that I\\\\nhad any anyway), nowhere to stand. There was a desk with a\\\\nchair behind it. If I sat there I would have been lost to view to\\\\nanyone who wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in the front row, and it would have seemed\\\\nvery stilted and formal. I could have stood there with my arms\\\\nbehind my back looking like Prince Charles talking to the\\\\npalace staff. I could have stood there with my hands by my\\\\nside or clasped in front of my groin like an embarrassed\\\\nschoolboy. But I was about to talk about stress\\xe2\\x80\\x94and its man-\\\\nagement. I needed to look relaxed, calm\\xe2\\x80\\x94as if I was practicing\\\\nwhat I was preaching, walking my talk.\\\\n\\\\nI solved my dilemma by sitting on the edge of the desk. I\\\\ncould swing my legs, lean back, lean forward, almost lie down\\\\nif I wanted. I met someone several years later who had been\\\\nthere and she said that she couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember a thing I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d said\\\\nbut had been impressed by how relaxed I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d seemed\\xe2\\x80\\x94and how\\\\nwhen I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d finished talking I sprang up and went off for photos\\\\nwith the local journalist. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember that bit, but she\\\\nsaid I seemed confident, relaxed, but also energetic.\\\\n\\\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re aiming for. When you walk through the\\\\noffice first thing in the morning, there should be a spring to\\\\nyour step. Let the others crawl in looking hung over or freshly\\\\nrisen from bed or exhausted from long hours commuting. You\\\\nwill arrive fresh and energetic, ready for the day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work, which\\\\nis easy to deal with, a mere nothing.

You need\\\\nto be smoothly in control\\xe2\\x80\\x94not hurried, not sluggardly, not\\\\ncowed or beaten.

You\\\\nare going to develop a style that gets you noticed in all these\\\\nthings. Dying your hair red and only ever wearing Goodwill\\\\nclothes may indeed be a style and one that does get you\\\\nnoticed, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not for the Rules Player. Think Cary Grant\\\\nrather than Boy George. Think Lauren Bacall rather than\\\\nMadonna. All have style, all attracted attention. But trust me,\\\\nCary or Lauren is what you want.

If you look at\\\\nsomeone you consider attractive, you will be hard pressed to\\\\nsee what it is they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got that makes them so good looking.\\\\nAttractiveness, if we ignore the obvious physical impairments\\\\nsuch as buck teeth or a warty nose\\xe2\\x80\\x94all of which can be cor-\\\\nrected\\xe2\\x80\\x94is very hard to define. Take any Hollywood stars, such\\\\nas Liza Minelli, Woody Allen, Julia Roberts, and Sean Penn,\\\\nwho aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t classically good looking, and we can see that they\\\\nhave charisma, charm, magnetism, a larger-than-life attitude.\\\\nThey come right out at you. They have life, presence, drama,\\\\npower, and personality.\\\\n\\\\nYou too must have these things. They are easier to acquire\\\\nthan looks anyway. Being attractive comes from within. Know\\\\nthat you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being judged at all times. If you dress well, pay atten-\\\\ntion to your grooming, cultivate that smile, look good and\\\\ncool at all times, and come across as friendly, warm, articulate,\\\\nand caring, you will also come across as attractive and good\\\\nlooking. Looks are all in the smile and the eyes. Smiles that\\\\nlight up a room are magnetic and powerful. Eyes that twinkle\\\\nand are full of life are enough to make us think the whole face\\\\nis good looking.\\\\n\\\\nAttractiveness is also about posture and position. If you slump\\\\nyou give off an aura of gloom and depression. This is unattrac-\\\\ntive and not good looking. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYour walk should be erect, proud, assured. So should your\\\\nhandshake. Everything about you should be up and open,\\\\nhappy and confident. This is attractive. Your grooming should\\\\nbe faultless, your dress sense superb, your style quirky but\\\\nsuave, your whole demeanor splendid and outstanding.

Will this get you a reputation as standoffish?\\\\nArrogant? Self-important?

You can choose to get involved in the social side of the\\\\noffice, or you can remain one step removed. This makes you\\\\none step away from your colleagues and thus one step nearer\\\\nto being their manager.\\\\n\\\\nNone of this means you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a laugh and joke with your\\\\ncoworkers; just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get so friendly or personal that it would\\\\nbecome impossible to promote you above them.

The Rules Player has a\\\\nplan\\xe2\\x80\\x94long term and short term.\\\\n\\\\nLong-term plans can be very simple\\xe2\\x80\\x94qualify, move up, reach\\\\nthe top, retire, die. Or they can be sensible and useful. If you\\\\nintend to have a career, it makes sense to study the game plan\\\\nof your chosen industry. Obviously, you will have to build in a\\\\ncertain contingency for the unexpected and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cout-of-your-\\\\ncontrol,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  but the shrewd Rules Player will have already\\\\namended their long-term game plan well in advance having\\\\nseen the indicators and read the signs.

That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entirely up to you. I have\\\\nthree short-term plans on the go\\xe2\\x80\\x94this month, this year, five\\\\nyears. This seems to provide me with sufficient information to\\\\nplan my workload. It also allows me to work in, in the short\\\\nterm, plans that affect my family. I can allow for vacations,\\\\nchanges of school, garden/house projects and birthdays,\\\\nChristmas, that sort of thing.\\\\n\\\\nYour one-month short-term plan should obviously list current\\\\nwork projects\\xe2\\x80\\x94deadlines, prioritized tasks, basic routines.\\\\nThis is for work actually being carried out.\\\\n\\\\nYour one-year plan should have projects that are being formu-\\\\nlated, planned, presented, whatever. This is for work being\\\\nplanned rather than executed.\\\\n\\\\nYour five-year plan should be for ideas, dreams, goals, wishes,\\\\nwants; it is for work you intend executing one day.\\\\n\\\\nYour long-term plan will have a career path built into it. Your\\\\nfive-year plan will take into it any steps you need to carry out\\\\nthat long-term plan.\\\\n\\\\nI tend to keep three separate records for these three short-term\\\\nplans. My one-month plan is kept on a clipboard on the desk.\\\\nIt contains a single sheet that lists boxes for deadlines, return\\\\nphone calls, things to do. I suppose it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bit like a calendar but\\\\nwithout daily entries.\\\\n\\\\nMy one-year plan lives on the wall. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a wall chart or year\\\\nplanner but, again, a single sheet with 12 boxes. In each box is\\\\na month with the relevant info of what I want to do during\\\\nthat time. It is what I want to do rather than what I have to do.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIt is a short-term plan, not a to-do list or a calendar or a work\\\\nschedule. As I am freelance, I have to generate work. This\\\\nwork\\xe2\\x80\\x94being done during my one-month plan or being gener-\\\\nated during my one-year plan\\xe2\\x80\\x94is my bread and butter. It is\\\\nmade up of projects I want to do and projects I have to do.\\\\nThe ones I have to do are the bread and the ones I want to do\\\\nare the butter\\xe2\\x80\\x94such as this book, which has been a delight to\\\\nplan and write. My five-year plan is for my general direction\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\nwhat sort of work do I want to be doing over the next five\\\\nyears? Your short-term plan will include work you have to do,\\\\nbut it will be mainly for work you want to do. The shorter the\\\\nterm, the more likely it is to read like your work schedule and\\\\nless like a wish list.\\\\n\\\\nAll plans should include practical steps to put into action and\\\\nmake them happen. Otherwise they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but vague\\\\nideas.\\\\n\\\\nWithin any of these plans, you have to build a contingency.\\\\nSomeone phones you with a project; you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn it down on\\\\nthe basis that it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in your plan.

Your game plan has to be who you\\\\nare going to be. Not many people choose consciously to be a\\\\nloser, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where they end up. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let it happen to you.\\\\nAnd it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen, once you seize the initiative and\\\\ndevelop a game plan.\\\\n\\\\nYour game plan is a sort of personal mission statement. It is\\\\ndifferent from setting objectives, which is how to be the\\\\nperson your game plan decides you are.\\\\n\\\\nSo who are you going to be? Successful? A failure? Someone\\\\nwho gives up? Someone who picks themselves up, dusts them-\\\\nselves off, and starts all over again? A brilliant career\\\\nstrategist? A loser? None of these?\\\\n\\\\nObviously, you could decide to be ruthless, unpleasant, cruel,\\\\nvindictive, but we assume you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\xe2\\x80\\x94a Rules Player is never\\\\nany of these.

And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\\\nnot just how others see us; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also how we see ourselves. We\\\\nall carry a mental image of ourselves\\xe2\\x80\\x94what we look like and\\\\nsound like, what makes us tick; how we work\\xe2\\x80\\x94but how real-\\\\nistic is this image? I think I work creatively and eccentrically;\\\\nothers think I am messy and unorganized. Which is true?\\\\nWhich is the reality?\\\\n\\\\nTo know your strengths and weaknesses, you first have to\\\\nunderstand your role\\xe2\\x80\\x94the way you work. I might see being\\\\ncreative as a strength\\xe2\\x80\\x94lots of lovely ideas, no attention to\\\\ndetail, generating new projects rather than seeing them\\\\nthrough or actually working on them\\xe2\\x80\\x94surely all these are\\\\nstrengths? Not if I am a Completer or Implementer they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\\\nnot; then they are weaknesses. Instead, my strengths would be\\\\nperseverance, diligence, stickability, predictability, conformity,\\\\nsteadfastness, orderliness\\xe2\\x80\\x94yuk, surely these are weaknesses?\\\\nYou have to know your role before you can make subjective\\\\njudgments about strengths and weaknesses.\\\\n\\\\nIf in doubt, make lists; that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I always say. Write down\\\\nwhat you think are your strengths and weaknesses. Show this\\\\nlist to a close friend who you do not work with. Ask for their\\\\nobjective evaluation. Now show it to someone you can trust\\\\nwho you do work with. Is there a difference in their evaluation\\\\nof how close to the truth you are? Bet there is quite a \\\\ndifference. This is because the special skills you bring to\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nfriendships are quite different from the ones you bring to a\\\\nwork relationship.\\\\n\\\\nThis rule is about knowing your strengths and weaknesses; it\\\\nisn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily about improving them, eliminating them,\\\\nworking on them, changing them in any way. What we are is\\\\nwhat we are, and it is what we have to work with. You may\\\\nwell be disorganized, erratic, unpredictable\\xe2\\x80\\x94is this good or\\\\nbad? It all depends on your role. You may need to change your\\\\nrole to suit your strengths and weaknesses better.\\\\n\\\\nA lot of people think that identifying their strengths and\\\\nweaknesses means they get to lose the bad stuff and only work\\\\nwith the good stuff. Not true. This isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t therapy. This is the\\\\nreal world. We all have weaknesses. The secret trick is learn-\\\\ning to work with them rather than trying to be perfect, which\\\\nis unrealistic and unproductive.\\\\n\\\\nYou might be able to find better uses for your weaknesses\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\nbut then they would become strengths, wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they?

In fact,\\\\nentire books are devoted to threats\\xe2\\x80\\x94mostly from change\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\nsuch as Who Moved My Cheese? and How to Handle Tough\\\\nSituations at Work. If we can think on our feet, stay out of\\\\nruts, be flexible and move fast, roll with the punches, and go\\\\nthe distance, we will not only survive change but we shall also\\\\nbe contortionists and athletes of the highest order. Of course,\\\\nwe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do all that. There will be times when the threat will\\\\novertake us and we get squashed. It happens to us all. There is\\\\nno getting away from the fact that life gets fired at us at point\\\\nblank range, and we rarely if ever get time to duck.\\\\n\\\\nBut a threat is always that. Once it becomes a reality, we can\\\\ndeal with it. While it is still a threat, it induces fear but can do\\\\nno harm. Spotting which threat will turn into a reality is the\\\\nskill. The talent. There are many threats, and we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t react to\\\\nall of them. There are fewer realities, and we have to react to\\\\nthem.\\\\n\\\\nIt helps if we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see threats as threats, but instead as oppor-\\\\ntunities. Each threat that becomes a reality is an opportunity\\\\nto grow and change, adapt and rework our methods and style\\\\nof management. If our attitude is positive, we tend to see\\\\nthreats less as a negative thing and more as a positive thing\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\nthey bring us the chance to prove ourselves.

He\\\\nleft school at 14 and ended up working all his life as a customs\\\\nofficer, working his way up to a middle management role.\\\\nWhen he retired at 65, he decided that at last he could afford\\\\nto get the education he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d always wanted. So he got a law\\\\ndegree, did his training, and qualified as a barrister at the age\\\\nof about 70. How many of us would have the attitude to learn-\\\\ning you need to do that? (Never mind the energy!)\\\\n\\\\nWhen you watch kids learn, you can see how much they enjoy\\\\nit. Not when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boring rote learning with tedious teachers, of\\\\ncourse, but when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re inspired and motivated they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\nbe happier. Well, you and I still have the same brain we had\\\\nwhen we were kids. OK, we may have lost a few little grey\\\\ncells, but we can still enjoy learning. And if we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t keep\\\\nlearning, we stagnate and become boring old stick-in-the-\\\\nmuds. If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t learn, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change, and if you aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\nchanging, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the point of being here?\\\\n\\\\nSo, make it your express purpose to keep learning. I know a\\\\nteacher in Scotland who dreamed as a child of becoming a\\\\nspaceman\\xe2\\x80\\x94like most of his school friends no doubt. However,\\\\nhe did something about it and, instead of allowing everyday\\\\nlife to get in the way of his aim, he lifted his head and made a\\\\npoint of learning and developing. \\\\n\\\\nAs a result, he won a scholarship to the U.S. Space and Rocket\\\\nCenter in Alabama for a week\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intensive space training, com-\\\\nplete with zero-gravity exercises and simulated shuttle\\\\ntake-offs. How cool is that? After that he could pursue his\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ndream of taking this knowledge and passing it onto the pupils\\\\nhe now teaches. All because he approached life as an ongoing\\\\nlesson.\\\\n\\\\nWe can all learn* from people like him. Remember what it was\\\\nthat inspired you as a child? Or consider the new things that\\\\nhave grabbed your interest since. Learning new skills for work\\\\nis valuable, from another language to new computer software.\\\\nBut any learning keeps your mind open and free and exercised,\\\\nwhich will benefit your work and your employer.

If you listen but\\\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pass it along or offer an opinion, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be seen as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone of\\\\nus\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rather than a party pooper.

It is also the domain of workers who\\\\nhave mindless jobs to do\\xe2\\x80\\x94jobs they can do without thinking\\\\nand thus have to occupy themselves with inane chatter,\\\\nrumors, lies, and malicious stories. Trouble is that if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\njoin in, you can be seen as severe or stuck-up. You have to\\\\nlook as if you gossip without ever doing it.

And when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\\\nfinished having a good moan, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have a good gossip.\\\\n\\\\nMoaning is pointless.

Simple Rule, but it\\\\nworks. Once they are there, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stop bitching; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too hard\\\\nto keep doing it when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve upset everyone in the office.

Now we all know that Adam is a pain\\\\nin the backside. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pull his weight, goofs off, steals the\\\\npens and paperclips, is rude to the security staff, always off-\\\\nloads as much work onto others as possible, blames others for\\\\nhis mistakes, and is generally obnoxious. So you all have a\\\\nmoan about him behind his back, and get a lot of your anger\\\\nabout his behaviour off your chest. But you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Oh, the\\\\nothers might but you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, not from now on. You are now a\\\\nRules Player, and you stand up for others.\\\\n\\\\nNo matter how obnoxious young Adam is, you will always\\\\nfind something nice\\xe2\\x80\\x94and genuine\\xe2\\x80\\x94to say about him. That is\\\\nyour objective\\xe2\\x80\\x94find something nice to say no matter what.\\\\n\\\\nAt first this may be quite hard, but if you persevere it becomes\\\\nincreasingly easy\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all a question of habit and mental out-\\\\nlook. If we are used to bitching and moaning, then that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\\\nwe do. But if we change our approach, we can be more posi-\\\\ntive\\xe2\\x80\\x94though it does take a bit of effort initially to make this\\\\nchange.\\\\n\\\\nStanding up for others, no matter what, gets you a reputation\\\\nas someone who can always find something nice to say about\\\\neverybody. Thus, those who you would have moaned about\\\\nknow that you, of all the work force, will always be fighting\\\\ntheir corner for them.

If you, at first,\\\\nsimply can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find anything positive to say, then shut up. But\\\\nthere is always something nice to say\\xe2\\x80\\x94nobody is completely\\\\nevil or wicked or nasty.\\\\n\\\\nSo, back to young Adam. What are you going to say?

You thus get a rep-\\\\nutation as being someone who is in control, smooth, relaxed,\\\\nconfident, and very mature. And all for the sake of a few bars\\\\nof \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMoon River,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whistled as you make your way to your desk.\\\\n\\\\nBe cheerful at all times. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s raining out there and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a dark\\\\nand depressing winter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s afternoon. Business is slack, interest\\\\nrates have just gone up again and the boss is in a foul mood,\\\\nand everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s keeping their heads down. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still no reason to\\\\nlose your smile. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bad day; this too will pass, and the\\\\nsun will come back. Whatever your situation, things will\\\\nalways get better.\\\\n\\\\nMaintaining a cheerful and positive outlook is a trick. At first\\\\nyou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to believe it\\xe2\\x80\\x94just do it. Act it. Pretend. But do\\\\nit. After a little while you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an act, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not pre-\\\\ntending, you genuinely do feel cheerful. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a trick. You are\\\\ntricking yourself, no one else. Putting on a smile triggers hor-\\\\nmones. These hormones will make you feel better. Once you\\\\nfeel better, you will smile more and thus produce more hor-\\\\nmones. All it takes is the first few days smiling when you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\nfeel like it, and you will start a cycle going that will make you\\\\nfeel better all the time.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you are seen as someone cheerful and positive, people\\\\nwill want to hang out with you more\\xe2\\x80\\x94there is nothing so\\\\nattractive as a cheerful person.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBring some flowers into work and brighten up your desk.\\\\nWhistle. Smile. Laugh. Never reveal that you feel like the pits\\\\ninside. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all too easy when someone says, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to\\\\nreply \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, OK, I guess, can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t complain, mustn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t grumble, you\\\\nknow, struggling on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a clich\\xc3\\xa9. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a habit. Try instead,\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFine, really good actually, doing OK.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a trick for you.\\\\n\\\\nSo someone brings you more work that you simply have to\\\\ndo\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unavoidable and part of your remit, and just when\\\\nyou thought you could see a little light at the end of the\\\\ntunnel. Easy to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh no, not more bloody work. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\neverybody see how busy I am? This really is too much.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\\\nunavoidable and moaning isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to change a thing, then\\\\nmaybe saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFine, just dump it there; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get on with it in a\\\\nmoment. Thanks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Why berate the messenger? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure he\\\\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t personally generate all this extra work just to piss you\\\\noff. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a drag having extra work to do. So what? So be\\\\ncheerful and get on with it. Every second spent moaning and\\\\nbitching is a second taken off your life.

What sort of questions? Well, that\\\\ndepends, obviously on the situation. For instance, in Rule 38:\\\\nCompliment people sincerely, we used a couple of examples\\\\nwhere the follow-up question is useful\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI really liked your\\\\npresentation.

It\\\\nshows you are interested in your colleagues. But do make the\\\\nquestions genuine and sincere, worthwhile and kind.\\\\n\\\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very little point in asking, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere on earth did you get\\\\nthat coat?

There\\\\nwill always be some aspect of someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work that you could\\\\nask about or their hobbies or social life or family.

Are you breaking any\\\\nlaws? Do you know the legalities of your industry?\\\\n\\\\nI once worked for an organization that was, initially, remark-\\\\nably above board. It prided itself on being a standard setter, a\\\\nnew thing in the industry. After a few years, it suddenly\\\\nchanged direction and lost the Jekyll to gain the Hyde. It was\\\\nquite bizarre, and I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see why it happened. Senior board\\\\nmembers hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t changed that much, and circumstances didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\nseem to demand it\\xe2\\x80\\x94we weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fighting for our lives here. But\\\\nsuddenly laws were being broken\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I do mean laws.\\\\nSuddenly I found myself working for a crooked and corrupt\\\\ncompany. What to do? I turned a blind eye for a while, but\\\\neventually I too was asked to participate in the law breaking. It\\\\nwas at that point I left. I kept my honor and reputation and\\\\nwent to work for the opposition, its rival. Once there, I was\\\\nasked about my old company and what it got up to, but I\\\\nwouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give any information that would allow my new\\\\nbosses to gain benefit over my old company. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why,\\\\nbut it seemed honorable to sit on what I knew. I was happy to\\\\ntalk about the way they did business, just so long as it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\nspill over into this area of legalities.\\\\n\\\\nA few years later I found myself working for a company that\\\\nwas taken over by my old corrupt bunch. By now the com-\\\\npany had been caught, punished, and cleaned up its act. Did I\\\\nwant to work for the company again? Not particularly. But I\\\\ndid have an interview with a senior director who said he was\\\\nhappy to have me on board\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt least you know how to keep\\\\nyour mouth shut,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.

You have to\\\\nknow what you might be asked to do and what is legal and\\\\nwhat isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Some industries have incredibly minute and trivial\\\\nlaws that you can run foul of almost without realizing it. But\\\\nrealize it you must. To be a Rules Player you have to be\\\\ncleaner than clean, above suspicion, and never allow yourself\\\\nto be scapegoated into anything. If your company is looking\\\\nfor a sucker, make sure it ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you. Make sure you stay clearly\\\\nthis side of the line, and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stray over it accidentally.\\\\n\\\\nIf you choose to break the law, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one thing, but how awful\\\\nit would be if you ended up in prison because you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\nknow.

If you have a simple Rule\\xe2\\x80\\x94never\\\\nlie\\xe2\\x80\\x94you have a default setting that requires no thought, \\\\nno choices, no decisions, no alternatives, no picking, no \\\\npreferences. \\\\n\\\\nNot ever lying also saves you from guilt, fear, recrimination,\\\\nhaving to remember the lies, the risk of being punished or\\\\nsacked or embarrassed, ostracizing your colleagues, putting\\\\nyour family in jeopardy, running the risk of a criminal prose-\\\\ncution, and not sleeping nights.\\\\n\\\\nNever lie is really the simplest, cleanest, most honest approach\\\\nto your working life and career.\\\\n\\\\nIt is, of course, OK to embellish and hype up your resume or\\\\nexperience or enthusiasm, but please don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually lie.

No. \\\\n\\\\nYou are allowed to talk up your qualities or skills or expert-\\\\nise\\xe2\\x80\\x94just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually tell a lie.

Again, be happy with a simple default set-\\\\nting\\xe2\\x80\\x94you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cover up for anyone, ever, under any\\\\ncircumstances. \\\\n\\\\nThis way it is simple. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to think about this. You\\\\nhave no choices or decisions to make. You know exactly where\\\\nyou stand. You have let your colleagues know exactly where\\\\nthey stand. You have let your boss know that you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cover\\\\nfor anyone; therefore you are above suspicion, trustworthy,\\\\nreliable, beyond reproach. \\\\n\\\\nIf you do decide to cover for others, it complicates your life so\\\\nmuch that it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really be worth it. For instance, do you only\\\\ncover for close colleagues or anyone who asks? Do you only\\\\ncover for small incidents or the big ones? What about cover-\\\\ning for fraud? Criminal negligence? What do you say and do\\\\nwhen you get found out? How do you explain it to your family\\\\nwhen you get sacked?\\\\n\\\\nHow do you handle it when asked to cover up for a close col-\\\\nleague who might well be a friend as well? You can be fairly\\\\nassertive and just say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to explain. Or you\\\\ncan soften the blow by saying: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask me, I would\\\\nhave to say no if you do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to give them a get-out clause and\\\\nsave their face.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOnce you have done this, it gets easier\\xe2\\x80\\x94you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve established a\\\\nreputation for not covering up. The hardest bit is ignoring the\\\\nemotional blackmail that often accompanies a request to cover\\\\nup for someone. But in reality that is quite easy to ignore in\\\\nthe sense that if people think so little of you to use this tech-\\\\nnique, then why the hell shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you turn them down? They\\\\nhave already cooked their goose by using such an approach on\\\\nyou.\\\\n\\\\nIf they put pressure on you, adopt the stuck record technique\\\\nand just keep saying: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, please don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask.

This specifies all those things that could get for-\\\\ngotten along the way. That way, when I deliver the manuscript\\\\nand the publisher says, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut this is only 100 pages and I\\\\nthought we had agreed on 200,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I can produce the contract\\\\nand find the clause where it clearly states 100 pages, or so\\\\nmany words, or whatever.\\\\n\\\\nIf your boss asks you to do something and you make a note of\\\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x94in front of him\\xe2\\x80\\x94he will have a very hard job arguing later\\\\nthat you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done it wrong or late. \\\\n\\\\nIf you have to submit a report, then drop your boss a quick\\\\nmemo or note outlining the salient facts, very briefly, so there\\\\nwill be no confusion later. Keep a copy. Make sure your boss\\\\nknows you have kept a copy.\\\\n\\\\nThis technique isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t to cover your back because you are up to\\\\nno good. Instead it clarifies all issues. If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in writing, it makes\\\\nyour job so much simpler, so much easier. Who can argue\\\\nwith a written memo? In fact, such things could be forged,\\\\nwritten afterwards, changed, amended, and/or rewritten, but\\\\nwe all assume they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, that they are tamper proof.\\\\n\\\\nIt is amazing how often the tiniest detail will cause a major\\\\nupset\\xe2\\x80\\x94unless you got it in writing in the first place. Keeping\\\\nrecords isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an anal thing to do, but a sensible precaution.\\\\nNone of us has perfect memory. We all forget things\\xe2\\x80\\x94dates,\\\\ntimes, details. Once we have made a note of whatever it is, we\\\\ncan refer to it later. And often surprise ourselves with how\\\\nbadly we have remembered something.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou will often read in management books the advice to throw\\\\naway all memo or emails or faxes over a certain age\\xe2\\x80\\x94if you\\\\nhaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t looked at it in six months then you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need it.\\\\nRubbish. You hang on to everything. Make more filing space\\\\nrather than throw anything away, unless and until you are 100\\\\npercent certain it is not needed. I once had a major quarrel\\\\nwith a publisher (not this one, of course) relating to a book I\\\\nhad written for them five years previously. It was a dispute\\\\nthat wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t covered by anything in the contract. But I had kept\\\\nmy original notes and could produce them\\xe2\\x80\\x94a bit like having\\\\nto show your work during math at school\\xe2\\x80\\x94and could show\\\\nthat what they had published had been exactly what they had\\\\nasked for.

Playing it straight is such\\\\nan unusual thing that they will have no defense against it, no\\\\nprotection. There are few management training books or\\\\ncourses that teach you to be nice, be straight, be honest. The\\\\nunspoken wisdom is generally be ruthless, take advantage,\\\\ndog eat dog.

Well there is an answer, and\\\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s this. Only allow yourself to get involved in serious relation-\\\\nships at work.

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably\\\\nwise to acknowledge that your boss is likely to give you the\\\\ninformation you need at the last possible minute, but you can\\\\nstill voice it in a matter-of-fact practical way rather than a\\\\nbitchy, critical way.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 62\\\\n\\\\n147B L E N D I N\\\\n\\\\nTHIS IS THE KIND OF\\\\n\\\\nLOYALTY THAT OTHER\\\\n\\\\nMANAGERS WILL ADMIRE.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKnow Where to Hang Out, \\\\nand When\\\\n\\\\nRULE 63\\\\n\\\\n148 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nThere are always key places where the high and mighty gather\\\\nat formal and informal times.

In\\\\nfact, he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. He did drink a lot every lunchtime, but the\\\\nafternoons were spent carefully siphoning off funds to his own\\\\naccounts.

You have to con-\\\\nvince them you are already a boss\\xe2\\x80\\x94see Rule 78.\\\\n\\\\nI remember doing my first book and naturally being terribly\\\\nconcerned with the look of it\\xe2\\x80\\x94did the cover look right, feel\\\\nright, smell right? The marketing manager, obviously getting\\\\nfed up with the interminable dreary phone calls from me to\\\\ncheck up on every little detail, finally said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTins of beans,\\\\ndear boy, tins of beans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what he meant, and he\\\\nhad to explain it all in words of one syllable. Each book is a\\\\nproduct\\xe2\\x80\\x94a tin of beans\\xe2\\x80\\x94it sits on a shelf and gets bought or\\\\nnot bought depending on factors over which I, the mere little\\\\nwriter, have no control\\xe2\\x80\\x94such as the position of the book on\\\\nthe shelves, the competition stationed nearby, the weather, any\\\\ndiscounts the bookstore happens to be offering, and on and on\\\\nand on. All of these things, including fascinating things, such\\\\nas the color of the cover, can affect sales. It was my job to\\\\nsupply the text and then to start thinking about the corporate\\\\nissues, such as how many tins of beans get sold in any\\\\naccounting period, what my percentage share of any tin of\\\\nbeans is, what the next tin of beans will be, and can we sell\\\\nthem spaghetti next time?\\\\n\\\\nWhen problems crop up, it is easy to see things from your\\\\nown point of view\\xe2\\x80\\x94how it directly affects you. Once you\\\\nmake the leap to corporate speak, it gets easier to stop doing\\\\nthis and to start seeing problems from the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s point of\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nview. This doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean you have to become a company\\\\nperson hook, line and sinker. In fact, you are allowed to be\\\\nhonest and express your opinion. If it stinks it stinks\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\\\nyou should say so. But say so from the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s point of\\\\nview and not your own.\\\\n\\\\nIf the company suggests a new procedure, immediately think\\\\nhow it affects your customers and not you.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 73\\\\n\\\\n173H AV E A P L A N\\\\n\\\\nIF  THE COMPANY\\\\n\\\\nSUGGESTS A NEW\\\\n\\\\nPROCEDURE, IMMEDIATELY\\\\n\\\\nTHINK HOW IT AFFECTS\\\\n\\\\nYOUR CUSTOMERS AND\\\\n\\\\nNOT YOU.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMake Your Company Better for\\\\nHaving You There\\\\n\\\\nRULE 74\\\\n\\\\n174 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nOne of the most satisfying ways to make your name in an\\\\norganization is to propose a change that will benefit everyone,\\\\nnot just your own job or even your department.\\\\n\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give you an example. I worked in a company that had one\\\\nof those suggestion boxes that most people thought was a bit\\\\nof a pointless exercise, and we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe anyone would\\\\ntake any notice of the suggestions anyway. Until this woman\\\\nwe hardly knew made a blindingly simple suggestion via the\\\\nbox. She recommended that all letters should be sent by\\\\nsecond class post as standard, unless there was a good reason\\\\nto upgrade it to first class. Up until then all post had gone first\\\\nclass.\\\\n\\\\nThis was exactly the sort of thing I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking about, for several\\\\nreasons:\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 It was incredibly straightforward and required no com-\\\\nplex explanations.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 It could be put into practice by everyone in the organiza-\\\\ntion at no cost.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 It was easy to implement.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 It saved the company a lot of money.\\\\n\\\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for, ideally. Simple, universal, and of\\\\nclear and immediate benefit. You can imagine how envious the\\\\nrest of us were when this previously insignificant employee \\\\nwas the focus of managerial praise and recognition. And\\\\ndeservedly so.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSo take a good look at your own job, and see if you can find\\\\nanything that will benefit everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x94maybe you can see a way\\\\nto do something cheaper, quicker, or better. Or perhaps you\\\\nhave (or can cultivate) a resource that everyone can use. This\\\\nis an extension of Rule 4 actually, but this time you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re finding\\\\nsomething that benefits your colleagues too. Such as collecting\\\\nlots of disparate information into one place so people can\\\\naccess it more easily. Or writing up a proper user manual for\\\\nthe phone system that every department can use to train new\\\\nstaff.\\\\n\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting the message: that if you look for ways\\\\nto create assets for everyone to share, the credit will rub off on\\\\nyou every time they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re used. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all about.\\\\nGenuinely helping everyone, and yourself most of all.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 74\\\\n\\\\n175H AV E A P L A N\\\\n\\\\nCAN YOU SEE A WAY TO DO\\\\n\\\\nSOMETHING CHEAPER,\\\\n\\\\nQUICKER,  OR BETTER?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTalk of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rather Than \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nRULE 75\\\\n\\\\n176 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nI once worked for a boss who asked who we worked for.

The juniors scuttled off leaving these\\\\nbigwigs to chat. I found that if I hung around also, sort of tidy-\\\\ning up the table, emptying ashtrays (those were the days) and\\\\nkeeping quiet, then I got to overhear a lot and was even con-\\\\nsulted on the odd occasion\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, Richard, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re part of the\\\\nnew invoicing procedures, what do you think of them?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This\\\\nwas my chance to shine.

You just ran over a\\\\nguy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foot in your car because you weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t looking. He is quite\\\\njustifiably pissed off. What do you do? You get out of the car\\\\nand apologize. Say, and mean, that you are sorry. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deny it\\\\nwas your fault. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell him it is nothing and he is making a\\\\nbit of a fuss and you once had your entire leg ripped off and\\\\nnever even noticed. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try and explain why you weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\nlooking where you were going. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try to brush off the\\\\nwhole thing\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have thought you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have been pleased to\\\\nhave had your foot run over by a top of the range Aston\\\\nMartin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And for God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t laugh. \\\\n\\\\nJustifiable anger needs a result. If you have done something\\\\nwrong, listen to the guy\\xe2\\x80\\x94he is angry. You have made him so.\\\\nListen to what you have done wrong. And then apologize and\\\\nfind some way to put things right. Show the person that you \\\\nsympathize\\xe2\\x80\\x94you may not be able to give him what he wants\\\\nbut you can still let him know that you appreciate his feelings.\\\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t brush his feelings aside\\xe2\\x80\\x94they are justified.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTactical anger is, however, another thing entirely. Tactical\\\\nanger is used to make you do things you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to. People\\\\nlose their temper to intimidate you. The worst thing you can\\\\ndo is let them get away with it. If you do, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll keep doing it,\\\\nto you and to others. You must stop them at once. The way to\\\\ndo this is simply to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like being shouted at/threat-\\\\nened/intimidated/bullied/whatever, and I shall leave if you\\\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop/calm down/put your fists down/let go of my throat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\\\nwhatever.\\\\n\\\\nIf they continue, then just leave.

I was his assistant many years ago.\\\\nWhen he changed companies he phoned me and asked me to\\\\njoin the new firm with him\\xe2\\x80\\x94more money, etc.\\xe2\\x80\\x94so I said yes. \\\\n\\\\nOn my first day working with him at the new company, he\\\\nsaid to me, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCall me Mr. Cutler.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d No way, Peter. I had called\\\\nhim Peter at the old place and was going to carry on calling\\\\nhim that. But not quite yet. There were several assistants, and\\\\nthey needed to get to know this new boss, this Mr. Cutler.\\\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what they called him, because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what he wanted. I\\\\nwaited until the moment was right and we were all gathered\\\\ntogether. Then I addressed him as Peter. \\\\n\\\\nHe couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pull me up short in front of my peers and they\\\\nthought, quite rightly, that I had secret access to him that they\\\\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. For me the Mr. Cutler nonsense was never mentioned\\\\nagain and I was the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csenior\\xe2\\x80\\x9d assistant because I called him\\\\nPeter. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in a name? A whole lot.\\\\n\\\\nYou need to know that Mrs. Robertson in accounts is always\\\\naddressed as Mrs. Robertson and never as Mary, although you\\\\nknow that is her name and you are senior to her. Why not call\\\\nher Mary? Because she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like it and she handles the pay-\\\\nchecks. They have been known to go astray, be very late, be\\\\nmade out for much less than the anticipated amount\\xe2\\x80\\x94and all\\\\nto people who inadvertently called her Mary.\\\\n\\\\nIn one job, I worked with an administrative manager who was\\\\nknown, for curious reasons, as Buckethead. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a long story,\\\\nand you really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to know. (No, believe me, you really\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.) He was addressed to his face as Buckethead by all the\\\\nsenior staff\\xe2\\x80\\x94including me as finance manager. He was\\\\nBuckethead to the board. He was Buckethead to most of the\\\\nsecretarial staff. But anyone else and he was Mr. Taylor, never\\\\nBuckethead. I have seen him savage a young junior who made\\\\nthe mistake and called him Buckethead. Now why this strange\\\\ndivision between who could and who could not call him that\\\\nname? I have no idea but I did have a very strange relationship\\\\nwith him. Technically, he was my senior, albeit if only slightly.\\\\nBut I was power hungry in those days, and I wanted to control\\\\neverything. I never ever called him Buckethead. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like\\\\nhim. To me he was always Mr. Taylor. Why? Because it sepa-\\\\nrated us and made me different from the other senior\\\\nmanagers. I stood alone and Buckethead could never get close\\\\nto me, never be a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfriend.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I played the aloof game and was\\\\neventually offered the general managership of the company,\\\\nwhich would have made him my junior. Success? Yes, but it\\\\nfelt a hollow victory\\xe2\\x80\\x94I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t playing the Rules as effectively\\\\nthen as now\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I left for new challenges, new horizons.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 90\\\\n\\\\n215K N O W T H E SY S T E M\\xe2\\x80\\x94A N D M I L K I T\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCALL ME MR.

Clones stay\\\\nlate. Drones stay late. Worker ants stay late. Rules Players go\\\\nhome when they want to\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that is invariably earlier than\\\\nanyone else.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the same with arriving in the office in the morning. Who\\\\nsays you have to arrive early? No one. It is one of those\\\\nunwritten rules we need to know, so we can adapt it to our\\\\nown ends.\\\\n\\\\nThe object of the exercise is to be thought to be working as\\\\nhard as everyone else. The game is to get away with being\\\\nthought of as a conformist, a drone, when in fact you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\nhave to because you are so much better than that. You get your\\\\nwork done in record time so you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to stay late.\\\\n\\\\nIf you ever watch motivational speakers, they always put their\\\\nhand up when they ask you\\xe2\\x80\\x94and the rest of the audience\\xe2\\x80\\x94a\\\\nquestion. This sets the lead, and you automatically put your\\\\nhand up because there is already one hand up in the room.\\\\nSilly, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it? But it only takes one of you to leave at a reason-\\\\nable time for everyone else to follow suit. Staying because you\\\\nthink everyone else is staying is called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpresenteeism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and is a\\\\ncurse of modern office life. We all think that everyone else is\\\\nwatching us, as we are watching them, to see who will be the\\\\nfirst to break, to leave, to incur the boss\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrath.\\\\n\\\\nIt is, however, a myth. The first to leave isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to be miss-\\\\ning anything. That person will be liberating the rest of us.\\\\nLeave now and set us free, please.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe fear of missing something is very real. But if we are lead-\\\\ning exciting and interesting lives, we know that we are the\\\\ncenter of the universe and that the others who stay behind are\\\\nthe ones who are in reality missing out, missing something,\\\\nmissing in action.\\\\n\\\\nPeople think that leaving early\\xe2\\x80\\x94or at the right time actually,\\\\nthe time we are contracted to leave\\xe2\\x80\\x94will draw undue atten-\\\\ntion to us, make us seem to be shirkers. But if we leave\\\\nconfidently and honestly, this doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen. We only get\\\\nviewed badly for leaving before others if we slink out, leave by\\\\nthe back door, creep away into the night with our tail between\\\\nour legs. So wave boldly and tell them, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLast one to leave\\\\nturns out the lights.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Whether it is fair to point out that if they\\\\nwere any good at their jobs they too, like you, would have fin-\\\\nished their work on time is debatable. You are allowed to\\\\nthink it though.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 91\\\\n\\\\n217K N O W T H E SY S T E M\\xe2\\x80\\x94A N D M I L K I T\\\\n\\\\nTHE FEAR OF MISSING\\\\n\\\\nSOMETHING IS VERY REAL.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKnow the Theft or Perks Rule\\\\n\\\\nRULE 92\\\\n\\\\n218 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nSo what can you take home?

Watch what they\\\\ntake, and make a mental note of it. This might come in useful.\\\\nYou, of course, will take nothing. \\\\n\\\\nI have known an entire department cleared out because a new\\\\nmanager suddenly got it into his head that they were all com-\\\\nmitting grand larceny because they took home copies of all the\\\\nsoftware used by the computers. At home they all had the\\\\nlatest Windows, Word, and Outlook Express but a lot of good\\\\nit did them when they had to sign on.\\\\n\\\\nWas it theft? It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter. It got them the sack. If one of\\\\nthem had been known not to do this, they would have sur-\\\\nvived. If one of them had known the new manager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s views on\\\\nperks, they might have survived.\\\\n\\\\nBefore you start filling your pockets, make sure it is worth it.\\\\nAre those pens really that attractive? Will you be able to sell\\\\nenough cheap pens to feed your family for however long it\\\\ntakes you to find a new job?\\\\n\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve looked at the unwritten rules of office life. One of these\\\\nmight be that you do take home perks. And if you choose not\\\\nto, make sure you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get labeled as a teacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pet or goody-\\\\ngoody or anything else that could get you ostracised. Be part\\\\nof the herd even if you steal nothing. Let your boss know you\\\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, but make the staff think you are the same as they are.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnd watch out for the free phone calls and the Internet con-\\\\nnection. These might not qualify as take home perks, but it is\\\\nstill theft to make free phone calls when you aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allowed to.\\\\nThere is a good chance they get monitored, so don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it.\\\\n\\\\nFiddling expenses can be part of the office culture. If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\\\ndo it, it can blow the whistle on the others who do. So what\\\\ndo you do? You have to be honest and above board, but you\\\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rat on your colleagues. Ask the audience? Phone a\\\\nfriend? Doing it might seem the lesser of two evils, but you are\\\\na Rules Player now and can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t condone such activity. Better to\\\\nsay in advance to your colleagues that they can do what they\\\\nlike or want, but you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a party to such irregularities.\\\\nWarn them beforehand, and then if they still insist on doing it,\\\\nyou haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dropped them in it.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 92\\\\n\\\\n219K N O W T H E SY S T E M\\xe2\\x80\\x94A N D M I L K I T\\\\n\\\\nBEFORE YOU START\\\\n\\\\nFILLING YOUR POCKETS,\\\\n\\\\nMAKE SURE IT IS \\\\n\\\\nWORTH IT.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIdentify the People Who Count\\\\n\\\\nRULE 93\\\\n\\\\n220 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nI once made a bad mistake\\xe2\\x80\\x94well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve probably made lots, but\\\\nthis one is relevant and sticks in my mind. I worked for a\\\\ncompany and we had a maintenance man. At the end of each\\\\nday, we wrote in the maintenance book anything that needed\\\\ndoing, such as changing light bulbs, and plunging toilets, and\\\\nHarry would do it. Mending broken chairs, that sort of thing.\\\\nWe had two offices, and I used to get quite cross that Harry\\\\nseemed to spend more time down at the other branch than at\\\\nour place. Harry was never anywhere to be found.\\\\n\\\\nMy notes in the maintenance book grew terse and sharper, but\\\\nit didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to do any good. I would have rollicked Harry in\\\\nperson if ever I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have been able to find him. He came in after\\\\nwe had gone home and did the maintenance work in the\\\\nevenings. The other office was getting all their repairs done,\\\\nand we were getting nothing done. It was intolerable, and I\\\\nresolved one evening to wait for Harry.\\\\n\\\\nHarry didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t show, so I went over to the other office. There\\\\nwas Harry having coffee with the big boss, my regional direc-\\\\ntor. I steamed in\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat the devil do you think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing?\\\\nI need you over at the other place doing maintenance, not sit-\\\\nting here drinking coffee!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bad mistake.

Because he was my regional director\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\\\nfather-in-law. He had juice and power and influence that I\\\\ncould only dream of. He was working at the other office\\\\nbecause he had been told to by his son-in-law. As I said, bad\\\\nmistake.\\\\n\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked for companies where it was the cashier, the CEO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\\\ndriver, the accountant, and the lunch room chef who had the\\\\njuice. Invariably, it took some time to identify these people.\\\\nThey all held some trump card that gave them access to a\\\\nsenior boss, or had some hold over them such as being a rela-\\\\ntive.

Our relationship was bad beforehand. Now it positively\\\\nstank. Do you think I could get a light bulb changed? No way,\\\\nnot now, not ever. Identifying the people who count and being\\\\non the right side of them go hand in hand, obviously.\\\\n\\\\nI once worked with an auditor who was a complete you-know-\\\\nwhat. Everything had to be done by the book. Every i dotted\\\\nand t crossed. This man would have made Attila the Hun look\\\\nlike a charity worker. But this was a man who counted. Not\\\\nonly was he the auditor, he seemed to have juice far beyond\\\\nhis role as an accountant. This was a man the senior manage-\\\\nment bowed to, listened to, sought advice from, dared not\\\\ncross, and were in fear of, and they generally treated him like\\\\nroyalty. \\\\n\\\\nI never quite got to the bottom of why he wielded so much\\\\ninfluence, but I had to work with it. And once I had identified\\\\nhim I had to get on the right side of him. I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been up to\\\\nthen. As finance manager, my department came under his\\\\nscrutiny constantly and closely.\\\\n\\\\nI had upset Harry at every step along the way. We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\\\nsee eye to eye. He was an accountant and I was a finance \\\\nmanager\\xe2\\x80\\x94there is quite a difference. My brief was to install\\\\nsecurity systems, improve cash flow, cut costs, and tighten all\\\\nfiscal procedures. His was to audit every penny.\\\\n\\\\nI took my kids to a garage sale one Saturday morning. It was\\\\nautumn and I felt cold, so I bought a college scarf at the sale.\\\\nYou know the sort, stripy, dark, traditional. On Monday I wore\\\\nit into work. I bumped into the auditor in the corridor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nhe said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know you went to Manchester University.\\\\nWell done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And he walked off. \\\\n\\\\nI hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a clue what he was talking about until it dawned on\\\\nme that the scarf was a Manchester University scarf. This was\\\\nthe university the auditor had gone to (no, I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gone there,\\\\nor to any university) and from then on he accepted me as one\\\\nof his own, a chum, an old college pal. I could do no wrong.\\\\n\\\\nThis was an accident. Since then I have engineered such inci-\\\\ndents to get on the right side of the people who count, the\\\\nones who have influence who shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.

There are no bad jobs, only bad attitudes to jobs.\\\\n\\\\nAlways look for ways of making such jobs better, more inter-\\\\nesting, slicker, and quicker, and realize that they are providing\\\\nyou with the means to shine.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 107\\\\n\\\\n253H A N D L E T H E O P P O S I T I O N\\\\n\\\\nTHERE ARE NO BAD JOBS,\\\\n\\\\nONLY BAD ATTITUDES \\\\n\\\\nTO JOBS.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCultivate the Friendship and\\\\nApproval of Your Colleagues\\\\n\\\\nRULE 108\\\\n\\\\n254 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nIf you follow all the rules outlined in this book, you will be a\\\\nthoroughly nice person, likeable, confident, agreeable, and\\\\nassured. You will be grown up but still a lot of fun to be\\\\naround. You need the support of your fellow coworkers to\\\\nmove up, and you need their friendship and approval. If you\\\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have these things, you open yourself up to the possibility\\\\nof being set up, pulled down, dumped upon, or seen off. But\\\\nhow do you cultivate their friendship and approval when you\\\\nare doing everything to get promoted above them, to be their\\\\nboss?\\\\n\\\\nWhat you have to do is be one of the girls/guys while retaining\\\\na modicum of detachment. You have to run with the sheep\\\\nand hunt with the wolves. You have to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone of them\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\\\none of the bosses.\\\\n\\\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to socialize with the staff without losing control,\\\\ngetting drunk, sleeping with any of them, or getting involved.\\\\nLaugh at their jokes, but don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go on vacation with them.\\\\nListen to their troubles, but don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell them they are trivial or\\\\ninconsequential. Support them and nurture them when they\\\\nare under pressure, but remain calm at all times yourself. You\\\\nhave to become their mother hen at the same time as their\\\\nfriend and fellow conspirator. You have to listen to their com-\\\\nplaints and moans about management and the boss without\\\\nrevealing who you really are\\xe2\\x80\\x94their eventual new boss.\\\\n\\\\nYou have to help them with their work so they get to rely on\\\\nyou. You have to be the diplomat, the conciliator, the referee,\\\\nthe pal, and the priest. You have to get them to love you\\\\nbecause you are so nice, so friendly yourself. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou have to be their tower of strength and their prop and their\\\\nchum. You have to make them feel special, feel that without\\\\nyou their lives are gray and dull and boring. You have to be\\\\nthe life and soul of the party and the party organizer and the\\\\none who clears up afterward.\\\\n\\\\nAll this is possible\\xe2\\x80\\x94not easy but possible. If you get on the\\\\nright side of your colleagues to such an extent, it will be they\\\\nwho push you forward, they whot want you to be their boss,\\\\ndemand of you that you lead. You will be the Rules Player par\\\\nexcellence.\\\\n\\\\nRULE 108\\\\n\\\\n255H A N D L E T H E O P P O S I T I O N\\\\n\\\\nLAUGH AT THEIR JOKES,\\\\n\\\\nBUT DON\\xe2\\x80\\x99T GO ON\\\\n\\\\nVACATION WITH THEM.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n256 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\\\n\\\\nKnow When to Break the Rules\\\\n\\\\nPOSTSCRIPT\\\\n\\\\nMany excellent and committed Rules Players I meet start out\\\\nfollowing every Rule. When you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re first setting out, this is a\\\\nsensible approach. After all, the alternative is complacency\\\\nand an assurance that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can do this stuff,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which certainly\\\\nisn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t true. None of us finds every situation effortless. It may be\\\\nclear what we should do, but that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always mean it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\\\neasy. And sometimes we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not sure which way to go.\\\\n\\\\nSo, by all means start out taking each Rule seriously. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the\\\\ngeneral idea. However, as you become more comfortable and\\\\nself-assured as a Rules Player and begin to develop sound\\\\ninstincts for Rules behavior, you can begin to loosen up. Many\\\\nof the Rules will become automatic, and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll no longer have\\\\nto think about them. And once you reach this stage, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find\\\\nthat occasionally one of the Rules really isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite appropriate.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no good persuading yourself a Rule doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fit because\\\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99d much rather not have to follow it. You need to be clear\\\\nand objective. But when your instincts genuninely tell you to\\\\nbreak a Rule, then go for it.\\\\n\\\\nPersonally, I find that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rarely a need to break a Rule. I do\\\\nbreak Rules occasionally. For example, a Rules Player never\\\\ndeliberately belittles other people in public, but about twice in\\\\nmy life I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve encountered people who really needed to be belit-\\\\ntled in public to stop them from doing it to others.\\\\n\\\\nIn the end it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about gut feeling. Follow the Rules until they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\\\nso ingrained they become instinct, and then trust your\\\\ninstincts. If you refer back to the Rules from time to time, and\\\\nyou work on the ones you find tricky, you can be confident\\\\nthat in time your instincts will serve you better than any book.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tContents\\\\n\\\\tForeword\\\\n\\\\tIntroduction\\\\n\\\\tPart I: Walk Your Talk\\\\n\\\\t1 Get Your Work Noticed\\\\n\\\\t2 Never Stand Still\\\\n\\\\t3 Volunteer

Most of us\\n(still guessing) want more important jobs, bigger salaries, greater\\nsecurity, higher status, and a bright future. So we try to do our jobs\\nso well that we will be rewarded, respected, and promoted.\\n\\nAnd that is where we go wrong. (I’m not guessing anymore.)\\n\\nOf course, we have to do our jobs really well. There’s no future for\\nthe screw-up, the bum, or the sociopath. But Richard Templar puts\\nhis finger on the flaw in the implied logic that concludes that the\\nbetter we do our job, the faster we will rise up the organization. He\\npoints out that we are all doing two jobs, but most of us are only\\nconscious of one of them—the job in hand: meeting our sales tar-\\ngets, reducing machine downtime, speeding up monthly\\nmanagement accounts, whatever. The other job is both larger and\\nvaguer: making the organization work. If people think you have it in\\nyou to solve the problems of the organization itself, not just your\\nsmall part of it, you’ve broken away from the pack. But how do you\\ndo that? There’s an easy answer: read this book. Follow the Rules.\\n\\nI realized when I read this book that I have always been half con-\\nscious of the Rules, though I never managed to formulate and\\nanalyze them with the clarity and detail that Richard Templar brings\\nto the task. There was a time when I had to interview a lot of promo-\\ntion candidates in the BBC, and with most of them I had this feeling\\nthat somehow they didn’t look like top management material. Was it\\nhow they dressed, how they walked, how they talked? Bits of all of\\nthose, but most of all their attitude, their frame of mind, which\\nsomehow affected all the others.\\n\\nMost of them stressed how well they did their present job, which\\nwas quite unnecessary. We knew that; that’s why they were there. It\\nwas their entrance ticket to the interview, and there was no point in\\nconstantly waving it at us. Amazingly few of them had given any real\\nthought to the problems of the job they were applying for, as\\nopposed to the job they were doing, let alone the problems that\\n\\nviii T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\n\\n\\nixFO R E W O R D\\n\\nfaced the BBC as an organization. They were oblivious of the Rules.\\n\\nThe American management guru Peter Drucker makes a useful dis-\\ntinction between efficiency and effectiveness: efficiency is doing the\\njob right, effectiveness is doing the right job. Your boss will tell you\\nhow to do the job right, but you have to work out for yourself what\\nthe right job is. It means looking at the world outside the organiza-\\ntion: what it needs, and how its needs are changing, and what the\\norganization must do (and stop doing) to survive and prosper.\\n\\nI remember interviewing two chief executives of great corporations.\\nBoth had joined from college with hundreds of other bright ambi-\\ntious graduates, and I asked them why it was they had gotten to the\\ntop of the heap and not any of the others. One said he didn’t know,\\nbut what he could tell me was that every job he’d ever done was\\nabolished after he left it. The other didn’t know either, but said that\\nno job he’d ever done existed until he started doing it. Both of them\\nwere striking examples of people who focused on doing the right\\njob, of thinking like the chairman even when they were junior or\\nmiddle managers. And I have no doubt they followed all the other\\nrules as well, always somehow looking and sounding like someone\\nwho should be in a higher job. And as Richard Templar stresses—\\nthey were popular and respected throughout the organization. You\\ncan’t be a successful chief executive if you’re surrounded by embit-\\ntered, resentful, and demoralized colleagues.\\n\\nThe Rules of Work is first and foremost a guide for the individual\\nmanager, an eye-opener for all those who would like to rise to the\\ntop but don’t seem to be able to find the map. But it is also very\\nmuch a book for the organization itself; the great danger is fossiliza-\\ntion, becoming preoccupied with its internal tasks and systems and\\nprocedures, and losing touch with the world outside. And this will\\nhappen if everyone is concentrating on being efficient rather than\\nbeing effective—in other words, if they don’t follow the Rules.\\n\\nSir Antony Jay \\nAuthor, Yes Minister and creator of Sir Humphrey \\n\\nFounder, Video Arts\\n\\n\\n\\nx T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nIntroduction\\nI first started formulating The Rules of Work many, many years\\nago when I was an assistant manager. There was a promotion\\ngoing for the next step up—manager. There were two possible\\ncandidates, myself and Rob. On paper I had more experience,\\nmore expertise, most of the staff wanted me as their manager,\\nand I generally knew the new job better. Rob, to be honest,\\nwas useless.\\n\\nI was chatting with an outside consultant the company used\\nand asked him what he thought my chances were. “Slim,” he\\nreplied. I was indignant. I explained all about my experience,\\nmy expertise, my superior abilities. “Yep,” he replied, “but you\\ndon’t walk like a manager.” “And Rob does?” “Yep, that’s about\\nthe strength of it.” Needless to say he was quite right, and Rob\\ngot the job. I had to work under a moron. But a moron who\\nwalked right. I studied that walk very carefully.\\n\\nThe consultant was spot on—there was a manager’s walk. I\\nbegan to notice that every employee, every job, everyone in\\nfact, had their walk. Receptionists walked in a particular way,\\nas did the cashiers, the catering staff, the office workers, the\\nadmin, the security staff—and the managers, of course.\\nSecretly, I began to practice the walk.\\n\\nLooking the Part\\nAs I spent a lot of time watching the walk, I realized that there\\nwas also a manager’s style of attire, of speaking, of behavior. It\\nwasn’t enough that I was good at my job and had the experi-\\nence. I had to look as if I was better than anyone else. It wasn’t\\njust a walk—it was an entire makeover. And gradually, as I\\n\\n\\n\\nxiI N T R O D U CT I O N\\n\\nwatched, I noticed that what newspaper was read was impor-\\ntant, as was what pen was used, how you wrote, how you\\ntalked to colleagues, what you said at meetings—everything,\\nin fact, was being judged, evaluated, acted upon. It wasn’t\\nenough to be able to do the job. If you wanted to get on, you\\nhad to be seen to be the Right Type. The Rules of Work is about\\ncreating that type—of course, you’ve got to be able to do the\\njob in the first place. But a lot of people can do that. What\\nmakes you stand out? What makes you a suitable candidate\\nfor promotion? What makes the difference?\\n\\nAct One Step Ahead\\nI noticed that among the managers there were some who had\\nmastered the walk, but there were others who were practicing,\\nunconsciously, for the next walk—the general manager’s walk.\\n\\nI happened at that time to be travelling around a lot between\\ndifferent branches and noticed that among the general man-\\nagers there were some who were going to stay right where\\nthey were for a long time. But there were others already prac-\\nticing for their next step ahead—the regional director’s walk.\\nAnd style and image.\\n\\nI switched from practicing the manager’s walk and leapt ahead\\nto the general manager’s walk. Three months later I was pro-\\nmoted from assistant manager to general manager in one swift\\nmove. I was now the moron’s manager.\\n\\nWalk Your Talk\\nRob had the walk (Rule 18: Develop a Style That Gets You\\nNoticed), but unfortunately he didn’t adhere sufficiently to the\\n\\n\\n\\nxii T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nnumber one rule—he didn’t know the job well enough. He\\nlooked right, sounded right, but the bottom line was—he\\ncouldn’t do the job as well as he should have done. I was\\nbrought in over his head because they couldn’t sack him—\\nhaving just promoted him it would have looked bad—and\\nthey needed someone to oversee his work so that his errors\\ncould be rectified quickly. Rob had reached the level of his\\nown incompetence and stayed there for several years neither\\nimproving nor particularly getting worse—just looking good\\nand walking right. He eventually shuffled himself off sideways\\ninto running his own business—a restaurant. This failed\\nshortly afterward because he forgot Rule 2: Never Stand Still—\\nor maybe he never actually knew it. He carried on walking like\\na manager instead of a restaurateur. His customers never really\\ntook to him.\\n\\nBy practicing the general manager’s walk, I got the promotion,\\nbut I also got it because I paid great attention to doing my job\\nwell—Rule 1. Once in this new job I was, of course, com-\\npletely out of my depth. I had to quickly learn not only my\\nnew role and all its responsibilities, but also the position\\nbelow, which I had not really held. I had stood in for managers\\nbut I had never been a manager—now I was the manager’s\\nmanager. I was in great danger of falling flat on my face.\\n\\nNever Let Anyone Know How Hard\\nYou Work\\nBut I was, by now, a dedicated Rules Player. There was only\\none recourse—secret learning. I spent every spare second\\navailable—evenings, weekends, lunch breaks—studying\\neverything I could that would help me. But I told no one—\\nRule 13.\\n\\nWithin a short time I had mastered enough to be able to do the\\njob well enough. And the embryonic Rules of Work were born.\\n\\n\\n\\nxiiiI N T R O D U CT I O N\\n\\nHave a Plan\\nBeing a general manager was both fun and pain. It was 50 per-\\ncent more work but only 20 percent more pay. My next step,\\nlogically, was regional director. But it didn’t appeal. More\\nwork—much more work but for not that much more money. I\\nbegan to develop a plan (Rules 24–34). Where did I want to go\\nnext? What did I want to do? I was getting bored being stuck\\nin the office all the time and all those endless dreary meetings.\\nAnd all that time spent at head office. Not for me. I wanted to\\nhave fun again. I wanted to practice the Rules. I formulated\\nmy plan.\\n\\nWhat the company didn’t have was a roving troubleshooter—a\\nsort of general manager’s general manager. I put Rule 4: Carve\\nOut a Niche for Yourself into play. I suggested to the chairman\\nthat a report was needed. I never suggested that this was the\\njob I wanted, but the agenda was obvious, I suppose. I got it,\\nof course, and became a peripatetic general manager, answer-\\nable directly only to the chairman and with a job description I\\nwrote myself. And pay? A lot more than the regional directors\\nwere on, but they didn’t know and I didn’t let on (Part V: Look\\nAfter Yourself). I cultivated their support and friendship; I was\\nnever a threat because it was obvious I wasn’t after their job.\\nThey may have wanted the money I was making if they had\\nknown, but they didn’t want the little niche I had carved out\\nfor myself.\\n\\nAnd I did this without being ruthless, dishonest, or unpleas-\\nant. In fact, I was always diplomatic when dealing with the\\ngeneral managers. I treated them with courtesy and politeness,\\neven when I had to confront them on some aspect of their job.\\nI added If you can’t say anything nice—shut up and learned the\\nrules in Part VIII: Cultivate Diplomacy.\\n\\n\\n\\nxiv T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nKnowing the People Who Count\\nAnd I quickly learned that if I wanted to know what was going\\non in a branch, it was best to speak to the people who really\\nknew—the maintenence staff, the receptionists, the cashiers,\\nthe elevator attendant, and the drivers. It was important both\\nto identify these people and to be on the right side of them—\\nRule 94. They supplied me with more information than anyone\\nwould have believed—and all for the price of a simple “Hello\\nBob, how’s your daughter doing at college these days?”\\n\\nThe Rules of Work took shape. Over the next few years I\\nwatched them grow up and gain maturity and experience. I\\nleft the corporation and founded my own consultancy. I\\ntrained managers in The Rules of Work and watched them go\\nout into the world and conquer their destiny with charm and\\ncourtesy, confidence and authority.\\n\\nBut I see you have questions. How do these Rules work—are\\nthey manipulative? No, you don’t make anyone else do any-\\nthing; it is you that is changing and improving.\\n\\n• Do I have to become someone else? No, you may need to\\nchange your behavior a bit, but not your personality or\\nvalues.You’ll go on being you, but a slicker, quicker you, a\\nmore successful you.\\n\\n• Are they hard to learn? No, you can learn them in a week\\nor two—but it does take a long time to really master\\nthem. But we are learning all the time and even practicing\\none Rule is better than none at all.\\n\\n• Is it easy to spot others doing them? Yes, sometimes, but\\nthe really good Rules Players will never let you see what\\nthey are doing; they’re too good for that. But once you\\nbecome a Rules Player too, it does become easier to see\\nwhat Rule people are using at any particular time.\\n\\n\\n\\nxvI N T R O D U CT I O N\\n\\n• Will I notice benefits right away? Oh yes, you betcha—\\nimmediately.\\n\\n• Do I still do them? I wouldn’t even admit to doing them\\nin the first place—I’m a Rules Player after all.\\n\\n• Is it ethical to use the Rules? Yes. You aren’t doing any-\\nthing wrong, merely utilizing your own natural skills and\\ntalents and adapting them, using them consciously. This\\nis a key area for understanding the Rules—consciously.\\nEverything you do will have been decided beforehand—\\nyou’ll still appear spontaneous, of course, you decided\\nthat as well—but you will be a conscious controller of\\nany situation rather than an unconscious victim. You will\\nbe awake and aware, living in the moment and taking\\nadvantage of your own abilities. The bottom line is that\\nyou must be able to do your job—and do it well in the\\nfirst place. The Rules are not for slackers. You think \\nyou work hard now? It’s nothing to doing the Rules \\nsuccessfully—now that really does take work.\\n\\nAnd let’s face it, you love to work. You love doing your job.\\nYou have to, to be wanting to read the Rules and to want to be\\nmoving up. What I am suggesting is that you consciously\\nthink about every area of that work and make changes to\\nimprove\\n\\n• The way you do it\\n\\n• How people perceive you to be doing it\\n\\nIf you don’t practice the Rules, you will muddle along, get by,\\nmaybe find what it is you are looking for. You may already\\nknow a lot of these Rules—and be practicing them—\\ninstinctively and intuitively. Now we will do them consciously.\\nIf you do you will\\n\\n• Get promoted \\n\\n• Get along better with your colleagues\\n\\n\\n\\n• Feel better about yourself\\n\\n• Enjoy your work more\\n\\n• Understand your job better\\n\\n• Understand your boss’s point of view better\\n\\n• Take more pride in both yourself and your work\\n\\n• Set a good example for junior staff\\n\\n• Contribute more to your company\\n\\n• Be valued and respected\\n\\n• Spread an aura of goodwill and cooperation around you\\n\\n• Be successful if you leave to start your own business.\\n\\nThese Rules are simple and effective, safe and practical. They\\nare your 10 steps to building confidence and creating a new\\nand more powerful you. And building that new you morally\\nand ethically. You aren’t going to do anything that you wouldn’t\\nexpect—and appreciate—others doing to you. These Rules\\nenhance personal standards and elevate your individual princi-\\nples. They are my gift to you. They’re yours. Keep them safe,\\nkeep them secret.\\n\\nxvi T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\n\\n\\nPART I\\n\\nWALK YOUR\\nTALK\\n\\n\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank \\n\\n\\n\\nThese first Rules are the underlying ones that govern all the\\nothers—know your job well, do it well, and be better than\\nanyone else at doing it. It’s that simple. The secret part is to\\nmake sure nobody knows how hard you have to work to do it\\nso well. You can do all your learning in secret, in private—\\ndon’t let on, and don’t let anyone know you do this—and\\nnever ever let anyone know you’ve read this book; it is your\\nsecret bible. The important thing is to look calm and efficient,\\non top of everything and totally in control. You glide through\\nyour daily work with ease and confidence. You are unflappable\\nand unstoppable. Bottom line is, however, you must be really\\ngood at your basic job.\\n\\n3W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s all too easy for your work to get overlooked in the busy\\nhurly-burly of office life. You’re slaving away, and it can be\\nhard to remember that you need to put in some effort to boost\\nyour individual status and personal kudos for your work. But\\nit’s important. You have to make your mark so you stand out\\nand your promotional potential will be realized.\\n\\nThe best way to do this is to step outside the normal working\\nroutine. If you have to process so many widgets each day—\\nand so does everyone else—then processing more won’t do\\nyou that much good. But if you submit a report to your boss of\\nhow everyone could process more widgets, then you’ll get\\nnoticed. The unsolicited report is a brilliant way to stand out\\nfrom the crowd. It shows you’re thinking on your feet and\\nusing your initiative. But it mustn’t be used too often. If you\\nsubject your boss to a barrage of unsolicited reports, you’ll get\\nnoticed but in completely the wrong way. You have to stick to\\ncertain Rules:\\n\\n• Only submit a report occasionally.\\n\\n• Make really sure that your report will actually work—that it\\nwill do good or provide benefits.\\n\\n• Make sure your name is prominently displayed.\\n\\n• Make sure the report will be seen not only by your boss,\\nbut by his boss as well.\\n\\n• It doesn’t have to be a report—it can be an article in the\\ncompany newsletter.\\n\\nRULE 1\\n\\n4 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nGet Your Work Noticed\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course, the very best way to get your work noticed is to be\\nvery, very good at your job. And the best way to be good at\\nyour job is to be totally dedicated to doing the job and ignor-\\ning all the rest. There is a vast amount of politics, gossip,\\ngamesmanship, time wasting, and socializing that goes on in\\nthe name of work. It isn’t work. Keep your eye on the ball, and\\nyou’ll already be playing with a vast advantage over your col-\\nleagues. The Rules Player stays focused. Keep your mind on\\nthe task at hand—being very good at your job—and don’t get\\ndistracted.\\n\\nRULE 1\\n\\n5W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\n\\nTHE UNSOLICITED REPORT\\n\\nIS A BRILLIANT WAY TO\\n\\nSTAND OUT FROM \\n\\nTHE CROWD.\\n\\n\\n\\nNever Stand Still\\n\\nRULE 2\\n\\n6 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nMost people go into work each day with only one thought—\\ngetting through to going home time. During their day they\\nwill do whatever they have to, to arrive at that magic time. You\\nwon’t. You won’t stand still. Having gotten the job seems\\nenough for most people that they will just do it and thus\\nremain static. But doing the job isn’t the end game for you—it\\nis merely a means to the end. And the end for you is promo-\\ntion, more money, success, amassing the contacts and\\nexperience to set out on your own, whatever it is that is on\\nyour wish list. The job, in a way, is an irrelevance.\\n\\nYes, you have to do the work. And yes, you have to do it\\nsupremely well. But your eye should already be on the next\\nstep, and every activity you indulge in at work should be\\nmerely a step in your plan to move up.\\n\\nWhile others are thinking of their next coffee break or how to\\nget through the afternoon without actually having to do any\\nwork, you will be busy planning and executing your next\\nmaneuver. In an ideal world, the Rules Players will have\\ngotten their work done by lunchtime so that they have the\\nafternoon free to study for the next promotion, to assess the\\ncompetition among close colleagues, to write the unsolicited\\nreports to get their work noticed, to research ways to improve\\nthe work process for everyone, to further their knowledge of\\ncompany procedures and history.\\n\\nIf you can’t get your work done by lunchtime, then you will\\nhave to fit all these things into and around the work. What the\\ncompetition will be doing is not doing them. But you don’t\\nstand still. Never accept that doing the job is enough. That’s\\n\\n\\n\\nfor the others. You will be moving right along preparing,\\nstudying, analyzing, and learning.\\n\\nWe talked earlier about the manager’s walk; well, that’s what\\nyou’ll be doing, practicing the manager’s walk—or whoever’s\\nwalk it is you need to master. You have to see promotion—or\\nwhatever else it is you want—as a movement. You keep\\nmoving or you grow moss. You have to have movement or you\\ngrow stagnant. You have to like movement or you grow roots.\\n\\nMovement requires of you that you don’t sit on your backside\\nand do nothing—don’t stand still.\\n\\nRULE 2\\n\\n7W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\n\\nIN AN IDEAL WORLD, THE\\n\\nRULES PLAYERS WILL\\n\\nHAVE GOTTEN THEIR WORK\\n\\nDONE BY LUNCHTIME SO\\n\\nTHAT THEY HAVE THE\\n\\nAFTERNOON FREE.\\n\\n\\n\\nVolunteer Carefully\\n\\nRULE 3\\n\\n8 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nA lot of people think that if they say “yes” to everything, they\\nwill get noticed, get praised, and get promoted. Not true. The\\nclever manager above them will use this “I’ll do it” mentality,\\nand you will end up overworked, undervalued, and abused.\\nBefore you put your hand up to volunteer for anything, think\\nvery carefully. You have to ask yourself various questions:\\n\\n• Why is this person asking for volunteers?\\n\\n• How will this further my plan?\\n\\n• How will I look to senior management if I volunteer?\\n\\n• How will I look if I don’t volunteer?\\n\\n• Is this a dirty job that no one else wants?\\n\\n• Or is this person genuinely, desperately overburdened and\\nreally in need of my help?\\n\\nIt might well be a dirty job that no one else wants, and by vol-\\nunteering you might look very good in the eyes of senior\\nmanagement—they think you capable of rising to a challenge,\\nbeing useful, and being prepared to get your sleeves rolled up\\nand stuck in. On the other hand, they might think you are an\\nidiot. Or if you volunteer to do the filing, they’ll see you as a\\nmere filing clerk. Or you might generate a load of goodwill for\\nhelping out someone in real need of support. Be careful and\\nchoose your moments. There’s no point sticking your hand up\\nif it means you’re going to be seen as a monkey. Only take that\\none step forward when you are confident you will look good,\\ngain benefit, or make a difference to someone who needs help.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso be aware that sometimes you seem to have volunteered\\nwithout putting your hand up or stepping forward. It just hap-\\npens that sometimes all your colleagues take a collective step\\nbackward, leaving you there out in the open seemingly volun-\\nteering when you really had no intention of doing so. The first\\ntime this happens, you will have to ride with it and do the\\njob—but make sure it doesn’t happen again—not to a Rules\\nPlayer, not twice. Keep your ear better attuned next time and\\nfeel out the collective approach. Make sure you’re stepping\\nbackward with the rest of them.\\n\\nRULE 3\\n\\n9W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\n\\nBEFORE YOU PUT YOUR\\n\\nHAND UP TO VOLUNTEER\\n\\nFOR ANYTHING,  THINK\\n\\nVERY CAREFULLY.\\n\\n\\n\\nCarve Out a Niche for Yourself\\n\\nRULE 4\\n\\n10 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nI once worked with a colleague who made it a great personal\\nskill to find out stuff about customers that we couldn’t. It\\nseemed he always knew the names of their children, where\\nthey went on vacation, their birthdays—and their spouses’—\\ntheir favorite music and restaurants. Consequently, if you had\\nto deal with a particular customer you went to Mike and\\nasked, politely and humbly, if he could give you some little\\ntitbit that would get you well in with the customer. Mike had\\ncarved out a niche for himself. No one asked him to become a\\nwalking encyclopedia of customer likes and dislikes. It wasn’t\\npart of his job description. It took a lot of work and unseen\\neffort. And it was a very valuable asset. It didn’t take long for\\nthe regional director to hear of this extra effort Mike had put\\nin, and his rise up the corporate ladder was swift, meteoric,\\nunprecedented. That’s all it took. I say “all,” but it was in fact a\\nlot of work and immensely clever.\\n\\nCarving out a niche means spotting a useful area that no one\\nelse has spotted. It might be as simple as being great at spread-\\nsheets or report writing. It might be, like Mike, knowing\\nsomething no one else does. It might be being brilliant with\\ncompany software or budgets or understanding the system.\\nMake sure you don’t make yourself indispensable, or this rule\\nbackfires.\\n\\nCarving out a niche for yourself often takes you out of the\\nnormal range of office activities. You get to move around\\nmore, be out of the office more often without having to\\nexplain to anyone where you are or what you are doing. This\\n\\n\\n\\nmakes you stand out from the herd and gives you independ-\\nence and a superior quality. I once volunteered to edit the\\ncompany newsletter—bearing in mind the previous rule—and\\ncould wander about between our seven branches at will.\\nObviously, I always made sure my work was done on time and\\nsupremely well.\\n\\nCarving out a niche for yourself frequently means you get\\nnoticed by people other than your boss—other people’s\\nbosses. These bosses get together and they talk. If they bring\\nyour name up it will be in a good way—“I see Rich has been\\nbusy doing some really original market analysis.” This makes\\nit difficult for your boss not to promote you if she wants to\\nwin her peer group approval. If the other bosses think you are\\na good idea, then your boss really has to go along with it.\\n\\nRULE 4\\n\\n11W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\n\\nIF  THE OTHER BOSSES\\n\\nTHINK YOU ARE A GOOD\\n\\nIDEA,  THEN YOUR BOSS\\n\\nREALLY HAS TO GO ALONG\\n\\nWITH IT.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnder Promise and Over Deliver\\n\\nRULE 5\\n\\n12 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nIf you know you can do it by Wednesday, always say Friday. If\\nyou know it will take your department a week, say two. If you\\nknow it will cost an extra two people to get the new machine\\ninstalled and up and running, then say three.\\n\\nThis isn’t dishonest, merely prudent. If it gets spotted that this\\nis what you do, then openly and honestly admit it and say you\\nalways build a contingency percentage into your calculations.\\nThey can’t kill you for that.\\n\\nThat’s the first bit. Under promise. And just because you have\\nsaid Friday or two weeks or whatever doesn’t mean you can\\ncoast and use up that allowance. Oh, no. What you have to do\\nis make sure you deliver early, on budget, and better than\\npromised. And that’s the second part. Over deliver. This means\\nif you promised to have the report finished by Monday first\\nthing, it is finished, but not only is it a report it also contains\\nthe full implementation plans for the new premises. Or if you\\nsaid you’d have the exhibition stand up and running by\\nSunday night with only two extra members of staff, you\\nhave—and you’ve managed to get your major competitor to\\npull out of the show. Or if you said you’d have a rough pro-\\nposal written for the new company brochure by the next\\nmeeting, you not only have this but also a full color mock-up,\\nthe complete text written and proofread, all the photos taken,\\nand full printing costs and quotes for distribution. Obviously,\\nyou’ve got to be careful that you don’t overstep the mark and\\nassume responsibilities you haven’t been given, but I’m sure\\nyou get the idea.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain, it might be stating the obvious, but don’t be too blatant\\nwhen you do this or your boss will get to expect it—it should\\nbe a pleasant surprise, not a frequently used tactic.\\n\\nIt also helps sometimes to act dumb. You can pretend you\\ndon’t really understand some new technique or software when\\nin reality you know it back to front. Then when you suddenly\\ndo all the budgets on the spreadsheets that no one else could,\\nyou look good. If, in advance, you had said “Oh, yes, I know\\nthat, I worked with these spreadsheets at my last place,” there\\nis no surprise, and you’ve given the game away—and your\\nadvantage.\\n\\nWhen you under promise and over deliver, you have to have a\\nbottom line—in your case, as a Rules Player, it is simply that\\nyou will never deliver late or deliver short. That’s it. If you\\nhave to sweat blood and work all night, then so be it. You will\\ndeliver when you said you would—or earlier if you can—\\nwithout exception. It is better to negotiate a longer delivery\\ntime in the first place than to have to let someone down. A lot\\nof people are so keen to be liked, or approved of, or praised\\nthat they will agree to the first delivery time offered to them—\\n“Oh yes, I can do that,” and then they fail. They look like\\npushovers in the first place and incompetent in the last.\\n\\nRULE 5\\n\\n13W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\n\\nYOU WILL NEVER DELIVER\\n\\nLATE OR DELIVER SHORT.\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn to Ask Why\\n\\nRULE 6\\n\\n14 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nYou won’t be able to do your best for your employer if you\\ncan’t see the big picture. You may be only a humble cog in a\\nhuge grinding machine, but if you can’t step back and see\\nwhat the whole machine is up to, you won’t be able to do your\\nlittle coggy things as well as you could. What’s more, if you\\nonly ever talk in terms of your cog and your immediate neigh-\\nboring cogs and bolts and shafts and pistons, everyone around\\nyou will see you as belonging neatly in that little part of the\\nmachine.\\n\\nBut you have aspirations to move into bigger and more impor-\\ntant parts of the machine, don’t you? Of course you\\ndo—you’re a Rules Player. You want to grow and develop and\\nmake a bigger contribution. And to do that—and be seen as a\\nsuitable candidate to do that—you need to understand what\\ndrives the whole thing and what its purpose is.\\n\\nThe way you do that is to ask questions. When your boss\\nbriefs you on any new task or project, ask how it fits into the\\nbig picture. Why are you shifting focus to selling by phone? Is\\nthis a standard market trend, or is your company trying to do\\nsomething innovative? Why is the accounts department split-\\nting into two—is this to benefit customers or to help the\\ninternal structure? And so on.\\n\\nI’m not talking about plaguing your boss with questions about\\nwhat color paper clip you should use for the pink triplicate\\nsheets and whether it’s OK to put your vacation request in via\\nemail. I’m talking about taking an interest in the whole organi-\\nzation and not just your corner of it, and letting your boss see\\nthat you have your eye on the big picture.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the reasons for this is, of course, that your boss will\\nstart to see you as someone who is capable of working at a\\nhigher level with a bigger overview, and someone who has a\\nloyalty and concern for the whole company. But you’ll also\\nfind that your own job makes far more sense when you can\\nsee the wider view, and that you’re more motivated when you\\nunderstand the reasons behind changes, new directives, extra\\nwork, or special projects.\\n\\nRULE 6\\n\\n15W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\n\\nI ’M TALKING ABOUT\\n\\nTAKING AN INTEREST IN\\n\\nTHE WHOLE ORGANIZATION\\n\\nAND NOT JUST YOUR\\n\\nCORNER OF IT.\\n\\n\\n\\nBe 100 Percent Committed\\n\\nRULE 7\\n\\n16 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nBeing a Rules Player means you are going to have to work a\\nwhole lot harder than any of your colleagues. They can coast;\\nyou can’t. They can afford to lighten up and put their feet up;\\nyou can’t. To move up, you have to be 100 percent committed.\\nYou can’t afford to lose sight of your long-term goal for a\\nsecond. For you there is no time off, no downtime, no loung-\\ning around time, no slipups, no mistakes, no accidental\\ndeviations from the script. \\n\\nYou have to become like a master criminal—they lead incredi-\\nbly law-abiding lives because they can’t risk breaking a tiny\\nlaw in case it draws attention to themselves and the really big\\ncrimes get revealed—and watch what you say and what you\\ndo.\\n\\nIf any of this seems too much, then bow out now. I only want\\ncommitted Rules Players on this team. You are going to have\\nto sign an oath in blood if you want to make this grade. You\\nare going to have to be vigilant, dedicated, watchful, keen,\\nready, prepared, cautious, alert, and on the ball. Tall order.\\n\\nIs it worth it? You bet. In the land of the blind, you will be the\\nonly one with both eyes open and seeing. You will be power-\\nful—and most importantly you will be having fun. There is no\\ngreater buzz than seeing the games that are going on around\\nyou and being completely uninvolved, utterly objective, and\\nsupremely detached.\\n\\nYou will find that you won’t have to do very much once you\\nstart observing. You will be able to give people a tiny nudge to\\n\\n\\n\\nget them to change direction rather than a huge big shove.\\nYour dealings will become incredibly delicate and gentle. \\n\\nBut you really do have to be 100 percent committed. If you try\\nthis stuff without such dedication, you will go off half-cocked\\nand run the risk of looking foolish instead of cool and in con-\\ntrol. But the beauty of total commitment is that you no longer\\nhave any decisions to make. You know your path exactly and\\nin any situation you only have to ask, “Does this further my\\nRule playing or not?”—and then the decision is made for you.\\nEasy.\\n\\nRULE 7\\n\\n17W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\n\\nYOU ARE GOING TO HAVE\\n\\nTO BE VIGILANT,\\n\\nDEDICATED,  WATCHFUL,\\n\\nKEEN, READY,  PREPARED,\\n\\nCAUTIOUS,  ALERT,  AND \\n\\nON THE BALL.\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn from Others’ Mistakes\\n\\nRULE 8\\n\\n18 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nA clever man learns from his own mistakes, but a wise man\\nlearns from others’ mistakes. That’s what they say, and any\\nRules Player with sense follows this principle. We all make\\nsome mistakes, but the fewer you make the better.\\n\\nIt sounds good, doesn’t it? However, you can’t just have the\\nodd catchy quote up your sleeve. You have to really do this\\nstuff. That means that every time someone near you messes\\nup, you need to know all about it. You’ll have to do your\\ndetective work, subtly mind you. No one wants to be cross-\\nexamined by a colleague about where they went wrong, and\\nthere’s a danger of coming across as smug and self-satisfied\\nand nosy and condescending because it wasn’t you who made\\nthe mistake, and that is definitely non-Rules behavior.\\n\\nSo when a colleague gets himself in hot water, find out what\\nwent wrong without getting spotted. One of the best ways to\\ndo this is to offer to help him put things right. After all, this\\nisn’t a competition, and we don’t actually want our teammates\\nto mess up. It’s just that if they do it anyway, we might as well\\nget some benefit from it. Helping them remedy things can be a\\ngreat way of finding out exactly what happened.\\n\\nOnce you’ve found out just what went wrong, work out how\\nand why it happened. Then be brutally honest with yourself\\nabout whether you could have made the same mistake. Have\\nyou ever been in a hurry and failed to double-check the paper-\\nwork? Or forgotten to check your voice mail at the end of the\\nday? Or negotiated on the basis of figures you took as right\\nbut could actually have been inaccurate? Or written down the\\n\\n\\n\\nwrong delivery date in your diary? If so, you need to devise\\nsome kind of system now to make sure it can’t happen in the\\nfuture; otherwise it’s only a matter of time before you make\\nthe same mistake. And remember, if you’ve already witnessed\\nyour colleague getting it wrong, you’ll look even worse when\\nit subsequently happens to you.\\n\\nOver time, you’ll find that a thorough and inquiring attitude\\nto other people’s mistakes, rather than a complacent, “It won’t\\nhappen to me” approach, will more than pay off. And the\\nfewer mistakes you make, the more you’ll impress the boss. It’s\\nas simple as that.\\n\\nRULE 8\\n\\n19W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\n\\nEVERY TIME SOMEONE\\n\\nNEAR YOU MESSES UP,\\n\\nYOU NEED TO KNOW ALL\\n\\nABOUT IT.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnjoy What You Are Doing\\n\\nRULE 9\\n\\n20 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nIf you’re not enjoying yourself, what are you doing? If there is\\nno entertainment value in your work, then there really is no\\npoint in doing it—you can probably get enough in unemploy-\\nment benefit to survive. I think there are an awful lot of\\npeople out there who really do enjoy working but are fright-\\nened to say so in case they get accused of being workaholics or\\nsad or something. \\n\\nThere is no shame in saying you enjoy your work. There\\nseems to be some kudos in being miserable at work, in moan-\\ning about your situation. There is a sort of office pecking order\\nwhere people try to outdo each other in moaning about how\\nmuch they hate their work.\\n\\nNot for you there’s not. The Rules Player enjoys work and\\nmakes sure people know that. Once you acknowledge that\\nwork is fun—and for you it is even more fun than for anyone\\nelse—you will find your step lightens, your stress levels\\ndecrease, and your whole demeanor lightens. By admitting\\nwork is fun, you are trading in a secret bit of knowledge that\\nonly really successful people usually have. Work is fun—\\nengrave it on your heart.\\n\\nHaving a good time at work and realizing work is good isn’t\\nthe same thing. Work being good means you take pride in\\nwhat you do, enjoy the challenge, and look forward to each\\nday with optimism and enthusiasm. Having a good time at\\nwork means not achieving much, talking a lot, winding up\\ncolleagues, and drinking champagne all afternoon. There is a\\ndifference, I’m sure you will agree. Having a good time at work\\n\\n\\n\\nis a temporary thing. It lasts while the fun lasts but quickly\\nflags once the excitement, the elation, has worn off. \\n\\nWork being good means enjoying the negotiating, the hiring\\nand firing, the day-to-day challenges, the stresses and disap-\\npointments, the uncertain future, the testing of one’s mettle,\\nthe new learning curves. A surprising number of people die\\nwithin a year of retirement—this suggests that work is more\\nimportant to our existence than we think.\\n\\nIf you ain’t enjoying all this and appreciating that it is enjoy-\\nable, then you are doomed to be one of the moaners, one of\\nlife’s victims. \\n\\nRULE 9\\n\\n21W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\n\\nTHERE IS NO SHAME IN\\n\\nSAYING YOU ENJOY \\n\\nYOUR WORK.\\n\\n\\n\\nDevelop the Right Attitude\\n\\nRULE 10\\n\\n22 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nAt work a lot of people have a sort of “us and them” attitude.\\nThey like to side with the “workers” and moan about the\\n“management.” You, on the other hand, will develop the right\\nattitude and not become one of the “us” mentality. No matter\\nwhat your position now, you are the next head of department,\\nan embryonic chairman of the board, a budding managing\\ndirector. You have to start to look at both sides of a situation\\nand identify the position of “them.” You may not voice this\\nand may even, in public, appear to side with your fellow\\nworkers and colleagues. But deep down, in your heart, you\\nunderstand and side with “them.” Never forget that. Your col-\\nleagues may moan about management policy, but you will\\nanalyze it and try to see it from their point of view. To fit in\\nand blend you may be tempted to adopt the camouflage of a\\nmoaning worker—not a wise move. Nod in agreement, but\\ndon’t moan yourself.\\n\\nThe right attitude is twofold:\\n\\n1. You side with management and see policy decision from\\ntheir point of view.\\n\\n2. You devote your attention to becoming a total and com-\\nmitted Rules Player—you look out for Number One\\n(that’s you).\\n\\nThe right attitude means giving it your best shot, not just\\ntoday but every day. Not just when it’s easy but when it’s awful\\nas well. \\n\\nThe right attitude means going that extra mile, giving it that\\nextra effort even when you’re tired and pissed off and ready to\\n\\n\\n\\nquit. Others can quit, but you can’t. You’re a Rules Player.\\n\\nThe right attitude is head up, never moaning, always positive\\nand upbeat, constantly looking for the advantage and the\\nedge.\\n\\nThe right attitude is developing standards—and sticking to\\nthem. Being sure of your bottom line and knowing when to\\nmake a stand. The right attitude is being aware that you have\\nenormous power and that you will exercise that power with\\nkindness, restraint, humanity, and consideration. You won’t\\nput anyone down or be ruthless or manipulative. Yes, you may\\ntake advantage of others’ sleepiness or apathy or wrong atti-\\ntude—that’s their problem. But you will take the moral high\\nground and be blameless. The right attitude is being good but\\nquick, kind but observant, considerate but successful. \\n\\nRULE 10\\n\\n23W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\n\\nYOU WILL TAKE THE\\n\\nMORAL HIGH GROUND AND\\n\\nBE BLAMELESS.\\n\\n\\n\\nBe Passionate but Don’t Kill\\nYourself\\n\\nRULE 11\\n\\n24 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nI hope you’re very passionate about your job. Whether your\\njob satisfaction comes from the people you work with, the\\nsense of achievement, a deep belief in what you’re doing, the\\nrecognition you get, the money you earn, or anything else—I\\nhope you get enough out of the job to feel very passionate\\nabout doing it.\\n\\nBut don’t fall into the trap of thinking that if you’re passionate\\nyou have to work long hours and jump through countless\\nhoops to prove it. Being passionate isn’t the same thing as\\nstaying late at the office. If you have a positive sense of belief\\nin your work and an enthusiasm for it, that will shine\\nthrough. Your boss will recognize it and, I trust, appreciate it,\\nregardless of the hours you put in.\\n\\nIt isn’t necessary to work yourself into the ground to be pas-\\nsionate about your work. In fact, it’s hard to sustain your love\\nof a job that is slowly draining all your energy. It’s what you\\nachieve that counts, not how long it takes you to achieve it.\\nYou might argue that if you’re really passionate you should be\\nable to achieve the same as other people in a fraction of the\\ntime. OK, that may not mean you can go home by mid-after-\\nnoon, but it does mean that your passion will keep your\\noutput high even if you knock off at 5:30 like everyone else.\\n\\nBeing passionate about your work, which is generally regarded\\nas being a Good Thing, is about caring whether you do a good\\njob. It’s not about how you work; it’s about how you feel. So\\nnot only do you not have to work long hours to prove your\\npassion, but it wouldn’t prove it anyway because it’s quite pos-\\nsible to work 16 hours a day and still not care about what you\\n\\n\\n\\ndo. It would be a pretty miserable life, granted, but I’ve known\\npeople do it.\\n\\nSo cultivate a positive enthusiasm about your work. If you\\ndon’t feel passionate about it, look for a new way to view it\\nthat makes you care, or work out what would generate that\\nkind of passion in you, and then create it in your work. Now,\\nI’m not saying it’s easy. For some people it’s a lifelong search.\\nBut I’ll promise you one thing—if you’re not even looking,\\nyou’ll never find it.\\n\\nRULE 11\\n\\n25W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\n\\nIT ’S NOT ABOUT HOW \\n\\nYOU WORK; IT’S ABOUT\\n\\nHOW YOU FEEL.\\n\\n\\n\\nManage Your Energy\\n\\nRULE 12\\n\\n26 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nHave you heard of time management? Of course you have.\\nEveryone has. I hope you’re good at it and doing everything\\nyou can to improve. There’s always room to manage our time\\nbetter, and the more effectively you work, the more you will\\nachieve and the more time you’ll have left over for yourself as\\nwell.\\n\\nWhat gets less well promoted is the need to manage your\\nenergy. I don’t know why this is, since your energy is one of\\nyour most essential resources and it doesn’t look after itself.\\nYou need to bring plenty of energy to what you do at work,\\nand it’s your job to make sure that energy is there when it’s\\nneeded.\\n\\nIn part this means looking after your physical energy. Make\\nsure you stay fit and healthy, and don’t wear yourself out when\\nyou have work the next day. Just as we make the kids go to\\nbed on time when it’s school tomorrow, so you should make\\nsure you don’t stay up late, overeat, get drunk, wear yourself\\nout, skip breakfast, or otherwise reduce your potential at\\nwork.\\n\\nAnd don’t forget your mental energy. What time of day do you\\nwork best? On a full stomach or just a comfortable one with\\nno hunger pains? What environment makes you most effective\\nat work—quiet, busy, pressured, noisy, companionable? We’re\\nall different, and you may not have total control over your\\nworking day, but you can make sure those tasks that need con-\\ncentration get allocated to times when you’re best able to\\nconcentrate and so on.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd there’s emotional energy too. If things are going badly in\\nyour home life, you need to find ways to bolster your emo-\\ntional mood before you get to work in the morning so your\\njob isn’t affected (there’s more on this in Rule 14: Keep Your\\nHome Life at Home). If you’re under emotional pressure at\\nwork, again, you’ll need to come up with constructive ways to\\nkeep your energy levels up—go for a run at lunchtime, tackle\\nthe person who’s bugging you, talk to your boss about your\\nworries.\\n\\nFinally, your spiritual side needs room to stretch to feel ener-\\ngized. For some people this can happen outside work, while\\nothers need to be doing a job that gives them a strong sense of\\nmoral worth. Only you know where you stand on this, but\\nmake sure that your job isn’t cramping your spiritual energy,\\nor in the end both you and the job will suffer.\\n\\nRULE 12\\n\\n27W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\n\\nIT ’S YOUR JOB TO MAKE\\n\\nSURE THAT ENERGY IS\\n\\nTHERE WHEN IT’S NEEDED.\\n\\n\\n\\nNever Let Anyone Know How\\nHard You Work\\n\\nRULE 13\\n\\n28 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nLook at someone like Richard Branson. He’s always seen as\\nplaying, flying balloons, living on a converted barge, flying to\\nthe States. You never see him sitting at a desk, answering\\nphones, doing paperwork. But at some time during his work-\\ning day that is exactly what he must do. We just don’t get to\\nsee it. Thus we think of him as the business playboy, the\\nhappy-go-lucky entrepreneur, the devilish entertainer. It’s a\\nneat image and one that he seems very happy to go along\\nwith—and why not?\\n\\nThis is the sort of image the intrepid Rules Player wants to\\ncultivate—suave, easy, relaxed, languid, in control, and very\\nchilled. You never run, never panic, never even seem to hurry.\\nYes, you may stay up until the early hours of every morning,\\nbut you will never admit this. Yes, you may work through\\nyour vacations, weekends, and days off, but you will never let\\non, never moan about how hard you work or the hours you\\nput in. To the outside observer you are coasting, taking it easy,\\ntaking it all in your stride.\\n\\nObviously, to be able to do this you have to be very good at\\nyour job. If you ain’t, then you’re going to fail trying this Rule\\nout for size. So, what do you do if you aren’t very good at your\\njob? Burn that midnight oil again getting good. Learn, study,\\ngain experience and knowledge, read, ask questions, revise,\\nsweat, and cram until you do know that job inside and out. Do\\nthis first, and then you can wonder about looking cool and\\nvery relaxed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are a few Rules within this Rule:\\n\\n• Never ask for an extension of a deadline.\\n\\n• Never ask for help: never admit that you are out of your\\ndepth—you can ask for guidance, advice, information, an\\nopinion, but never help.\\n\\n• Never moan or complain about how much work you have\\nto do.\\n\\n• Learn to be assertive so you don’t get overloaded—this is\\nnot about letting others know how hard you do work, but\\nyou don’t have to overdo it and overwork.\\n\\n• Never be seen breaking into a sweat.\\n\\n• Always look for ways to ease your workload—unnoticed\\nof course—and ways to speed things up.\\n\\nRULE 13\\n\\n29W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\n\\nTO BE ABLE TO DO THIS\\n\\nYOU HAVE TO BE VERY\\n\\nGOOD AT YOUR JOB.\\n\\n\\n\\nKeep Your Home Life at Home\\n\\nRULE 14\\n\\n30 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nWhen you go to work, you’re supposed to be focused on\\nwork. To get on with your job. If you spend your time focused\\non what goes on at home, people will assume you’re not really\\ncommitted to your job. And they’ll probably be right, if the\\ntruth be told.\\n\\nThink of the people you’ve worked with in the past—or\\nindeed now—who spent their time chatting about their fami-\\nlies, relating details of their social life, complaining about their\\nmother, fantasizing about their vacations, discussing their\\nlatest shopping trip, whining about health care, and telling\\nyou about their plans for Christmas. How many of them\\nwould you describe as passionate and committed to their\\nwork? Probably none of them.\\n\\nYou don’t have to keep your personal life so private that your\\ncolleagues don’t even know that you have kids, that your\\nmother is in the hospital, or that you enjoy fishing. But you do\\nhave to keep your personal life well in the background and\\nconcentrate on your job during working hours. That will\\nensure that you do the best job you can in the quickest time\\nand the most effective way. That will ensure that your boss,\\nand your boss’s boss, see you as a focused and enthusiastic\\nworker. And that will ensure that you enjoy the job more and\\nfind it more satisfying—no one can enjoy themselves fully\\nwhen their mind is elsewhere.\\n\\nYour colleagues don’t need to know about your personal prob-\\nlems. Sure, you need to have an outlet and good friends to talk\\nto, but not during working hours. If you have good friends\\n\\n\\n\\namong your coworkers, have a drink after work to discuss\\nyour problems.\\n\\nListen, everyone has an ailing parent, a child who’s going\\nthrough a tricky patch at school, an irritating neighbor, a\\nmortgage they can barely afford, or a sister-in-law from hell\\ncoming to stay for the weekend. They don’t need to hear about\\nyour problems. Sorry, but that’s the way it is. I’m not unsym-\\npathetic, but this isn’t the time or the place for it.\\n\\nOf course, I realize that there are occasionally major problems\\nthat will have some impact on your work. One of those very\\nrare and exceptional events like a divorce or a bereavement. In\\nthese cases, of course, you won’t be able to hide it at work,\\nand you should let your boss know why you’re not quite so on\\nthe ball for a few days or weeks. But if you’re doing your best,\\nand you have a reputation for being work-focused and keep-\\ning your personal life out of the job, the people around you\\nwill be so much more understanding and sympathetic when\\nyou really need them to be.\\n\\nRULE 14\\n\\n31W A L K Y O U R TA L K\\n\\nNO ONE CAN ENJOY\\n\\nTHEMSELVES FULLY WHEN\\n\\nTHEIR MIND IS\\n\\nELSEWHERE.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank \\n\\n\\n\\nPART II\\n\\nKNOW THAT\\nYOU’RE BEING\\n\\nJUDGED AT \\nALL TIMES\\n\\n\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank \\n\\n\\n\\nEverything about us speaks volumes to others.

Smile no matter what. Smile when you greet\\nyour colleagues in the morning. Smile when you shake hands.\\nSmile when it’s getting tough. Smile when it’s hell. Smile no\\nmatter what. \\n\\nAnd what sort of smile? Friendly, genuine—make sure it\\nextends to your eyes—sincere, frank, honest, open, happy.\\nAnd the easiest way to make your smile all these things is to\\nbelieve them all. This can’t be an act or it’ll be spotted immedi-\\nately. It has to be genuine to appear genuine. You have to feel\\nhappy. You have to be enjoying this or your smile will look\\ninsincere and false. And if you’re not enjoying this, then stop\\npretending with a fake smile and get the hell out.\\n\\nWe’ll assume your smile is real and that it comes from genuine\\nhappiness and friendliness. Now it is legit to improve on your\\nsmile, to rehearse it, to make it better. But it has to be there in\\nthe first place. We’ll assume it is.\\n\\nLook in the mirror and smile. Chances are it will look all\\nwrong. Of course it will. You can only see yourself front on.\\nAnd photos don’t work either, they’re in 2D and there is a lot\\nmissing when you look at them. You need to see your smile\\nfrom all angles, in 3D, and there is only one way to see this\\nand that is on film—video or whatever.\\n\\nIf you feel embarrassed getting a partner or friend to video you\\nso you can improve your smile, then you’ll have to set it up\\nyourself. Please don’t make the mistake I once made. I was a\\n\\nCultivate a Smile\\n\\n\\n\\nfinance manager and was asked to cover for one of our super-\\nmarket managers for an afternoon. The store was empty, and I\\nspent a most enjoyable afternoon practicing my walk, my\\nsmile, my general appearance on the CCTV system in the\\nstore. I would go back to the office and watch the results as I\\nchanged a slight part of whatever bit I was unhappy with. It\\nwas great fun. A few weeks later I was invited to watch a spe-\\ncial show for all the staff. Yes, I had forgotten to wipe the tape\\nand the shop manager—bless him—had found it and had\\nbeen putting on shows for all the general staff. I was forced to\\nsit through the whole thing while my coworkers commented\\non it and pointed out where I was going wrong. Very droll,\\nvery funny.\\n\\nSo to improve your smile, make sure you aren’t doing a lop-\\nsided grin, that your teeth can be seen but not too much, that\\nyou look happy and honest. Keep practicing until you get it\\nright.\\n\\nIT  HAS TO BE GENUINE TO\\n\\nAPPEAR GENUINE.\\n\\nRULE 15\\n\\n37K N O W T H AT Y O U’R E B E I N G J U D G E D AT A L L T I M E S\\n\\n\\n\\nNo Limp Fish—Develop the\\nPerfect Handshake\\n\\nRULE 16\\n\\n38 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nWe shake hands often and usually quite unconsciously. How\\nmany times do you have to shake hands during a normal busi-\\nness week? And how much thought do you give to it? There\\nare so many signals given during that brief handshake though,\\nthat you really ought to make it supremely confident, utterly\\nsecure, and convincingly reassuring. When someone shakes\\nhands with you, he should be left with the impression of\\nstrength, confidence, power, and of someone totally in control\\nof himself—that’s you, of course. If you are in any doubt about\\nthe “rightness” of your handshake, get a friend to tell you.\\n\\nHow do you make it better? Make it firm. You can always use\\nthe other hand to reassuringly grip both your hand and that of\\nyour boss/colleague/client. But don’t overdo it and leave this\\nperson with crushed fingers. \\n\\nYou can always adapt your handshake to make it more indi-\\nvidual, more memorable. My grandfather had a wonderful\\nhandshake. He just used his first two fingers (the fore and\\nindex) and his thumb and gripped very firmly. You felt as if\\nyou were shaking hands with royalty.\\n\\nHandshakes are very formal, old-fashioned things. Forget\\nabout the high fives, the Masonic twitches, or anything\\ngangsta-style. Stick to the old-fashioned sort of shake and you\\nwill be remembered as someone confident and authoritative.\\n\\nGood shakers are the ones who proffer their hand first as well\\nas shaking well. They exude confidence by announcing their\\nname and offering their hand at the same time thus showing\\nkeenness, friendliness, a relaxed and confident approach, and\\n\\n\\n\\na general air of assertiveness. They also look you in the eyes\\nand say your name back to you. We like hearing our own\\nname, and it’s an aide memoire.\\n\\nWhen you do announce your name, the word that goes first is\\n“Hello.” That’s it. You might like to be modern and friendly\\nand say “Hi”—that’s up to you. But the good Rules Player says\\n“Hello.” And follows that with her name. And your name is\\nalso formal and old fashioned. It is never “Hi, I’m Dave, from\\nMarketing.” The effect is pleasant enough and certainly\\nfriendly, but you will have impressed no one, gained no bene-\\nfit or advantage, and brought yourself down to just about the\\nlevel of the most junior person there. Much better to say,\\n“Hello, I’m David Simpson, Marketing Manager.” This imme-\\ndiately separates you from the herd and makes you more\\nsenior to anyone else there. Follow this up with a firm, confi-\\ndent handshake, and you will have them eating out of your\\nhand.\\n\\nRULE 16\\n\\n39K N O W T H AT Y O U’R E B E I N G J U D G E D AT A L L T I M E S\\n\\nFORGET ABOUT THE HIGH\\n\\nFIVES,  THE MASONIC\\n\\nTWITCHES,  OR ANYTHING\\n\\nGANGSTA-STYLE.\\n\\n\\n\\nExude Confidence and Energy\\n\\nRULE 17\\n\\n40 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nI once had to give a talk to a large group of businesswomen\\nabout stress management. As I walked to the front to start my\\ntalk, I noticed that there was no lectern for notes (not that I\\nhad any anyway), nowhere to stand. There was a desk with a\\nchair behind it. If I sat there I would have been lost to view to\\nanyone who wasn’t in the front row, and it would have seemed\\nvery stilted and formal. I could have stood there with my arms\\nbehind my back looking like Prince Charles talking to the\\npalace staff. I could have stood there with my hands by my\\nside or clasped in front of my groin like an embarrassed\\nschoolboy. But I was about to talk about stress—and its man-\\nagement. I needed to look relaxed, calm—as if I was practicing\\nwhat I was preaching, walking my talk.\\n\\nI solved my dilemma by sitting on the edge of the desk. I\\ncould swing my legs, lean back, lean forward, almost lie down\\nif I wanted. I met someone several years later who had been\\nthere and she said that she couldn’t remember a thing I’d said\\nbut had been impressed by how relaxed I’d seemed—and how\\nwhen I’d finished talking I sprang up and went off for photos\\nwith the local journalist. I don’t remember that bit, but she\\nsaid I seemed confident, relaxed, but also energetic.\\n\\nThat’s what we’re aiming for. When you walk through the\\noffice first thing in the morning, there should be a spring to\\nyour step. Let the others crawl in looking hung over or freshly\\nrisen from bed or exhausted from long hours commuting. You\\nwill arrive fresh and energetic, ready for the day’s work, which\\nis easy to deal with, a mere nothing. Walk quickly rather than\\nslowly—quick means keen, means energy, means awake and\\n\\n\\n\\nlively and ready for the challenges the day will throw your\\nway.\\n\\nNot too quick though, or you’ll seem to be in a rush.

You\\nare going to develop a style that gets you noticed in all these\\nthings. Dying your hair red and only ever wearing Goodwill\\nclothes may indeed be a style and one that does get you\\nnoticed, but it’s not for the Rules Player. Think Cary Grant\\nrather than Boy George. Think Lauren Bacall rather than\\nMadonna. All have style, all attracted attention. But trust me,\\nCary or Lauren is what you want. Classic, timeless, quality.\\nYou have various options if you want to adopt a style:\\n\\n• Choose one thing and get known for it—always wear black,\\nor double breasted, or Armani, or have a classy handbag/\\nbriefcase collection. Develop a trademark dress style—and\\nstick to it.\\n\\n• Only ever buy the very best you can afford.\\n\\n• Never wear anything tight—loose clothes talk of quality and\\nelegance, tight clothes of poverty and cheapness.\\n\\n• Less is more—cut down on jewelry and buy/wear only the\\nvery best, the finest. If it’s not expensive, then don’t wear it.\\nYou’ll find that if you only limit yourself to very expensive\\nitems, it helps you eliminate anything that might be consid-\\nered dubious or of questionable taste—spending a lot\\nmakes you much more discriminating.\\n\\n• If you wear make-up, then stick to what suits you, what\\nmakes you look good. Don’t change your makeup with the\\nseasons or with what’s in vogue—be known for your look,\\nbe instantly recognizable, be stylish.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlways dress up rather than down—formal is best, informal is\\nworst.\\n\\nMake sure all accessories follow the same Rules as your dress\\nsense—stylish, expensive, loose, recognizable, tasteful. There’s\\nnot a lot of point in looking good and then dragging round a\\nbattered old briefcase that’s seen better days—not unless, of\\ncourse, that’s your trademark, in which case make sure the\\nbriefcase is very old and very battered and very expensive.\\n\\nRULE 18\\n\\n43K N O W T H AT Y O U’R E B E I N G J U D G E D AT A L L T I M E S\\n\\nTHINK CARY GRANT\\n\\nRATHER THAN \\n\\nBOY GEORGE.  \\n\\nTHINK LAUREN BACALL\\n\\nRATHER THAN MADONNA.\\n\\n\\n\\nPay Attention to Personal\\nGrooming\\n\\nRULE 19\\n\\n44 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nEach and every morning you need to check that your personal\\ngrooming is in tip-top condition. Details really matter. You let\\none thing go and it will be noticed—and it could be the one\\nthing that makes the vital difference between a promotion and\\na rejection. Make each day as conscientious as an interview\\nday.

Take any Hollywood stars, such\\nas Liza Minelli, Woody Allen, Julia Roberts, and Sean Penn,\\nwho aren’t classically good looking, and we can see that they\\nhave charisma, charm, magnetism, a larger-than-life attitude.\\nThey come right out at you.

Know\\nthat you’re being judged at all times. If you dress well, pay atten-\\ntion to your grooming, cultivate that smile, look good and\\ncool at all times, and come across as friendly, warm, articulate,\\nand caring, you will also come across as attractive and good\\nlooking. Looks are all in the smile and the eyes. Smiles that\\nlight up a room are magnetic and powerful. Eyes that twinkle\\nand are full of life are enough to make us think the whole face\\nis good looking.\\n\\nAttractiveness is also about posture and position.

Stay cool at all times. Give\\ngenerously, support the cause, but leave the red noses for\\nothers to wear—at least when you’re at work. Remain civilized\\nand sophisticated at all times. \\n\\nLet’s face it, you are there to do a job. That’s what they pay you\\nfor. You ain’t there to make a fool of yourself. Just so long as\\nyou do that job—and do it well—the way you do it is up to\\nyou. You can choose to get involved in the social side of the\\noffice, or you can remain one step removed. This makes you\\none step away from your colleagues and thus one step nearer\\nto being their manager.\\n\\nNone of this means you can’t have a laugh and joke with your\\ncoworkers; just don’t get so friendly or personal that it would\\nbecome impossible to promote you above them. If you are\\ngoing to be their boss soon, then it pays to keep a little bit of\\ndistance. And you do this by being cool.\\n\\nIf you don’t know what cool is, try typing cool into your word\\nprocessor and then, using the Thesaurus option, look for\\nantonyms. You get: warm, excited, unfashionable. For warm,\\n\\n\\n\\nthink sweaty hands—uncool. For excited, think small boy on\\nChristmas Day—cute but uncool. For unfashionable think\\nchunky cardigans—warm and uncool.\\n\\nSo we want to be\\n\\n• Not warm—think not sweaty.\\n\\n• Not excited—think not panicked.\\n\\n• Not unfashionable—this isn’t the same as fashionable but\\nrather a timeless stylishness, which is, of course, com-\\npletely different.\\n\\nCool operators are relaxed and in control. In a crisis they don’t\\nrush about screaming, but rather implement safety procedures\\nand calmly and smoothly handle the situation. They are cool.\\nThey keep their heads and their composure. And invariably\\nthese are the people who others will turn to in a difficult situa-\\ntion. You don’t want someone who panics; you want someone\\ncool, calm, and collected. \\n\\nRULE 21\\n\\n49K N O W T H AT Y O U’R E B E I N G J U D G E D AT A L L T I M E S\\n\\nREMAIN CIVILIZED \\n\\nAND SOPHISTICATED \\n\\nAT ALL TIMES.\\n\\n\\n\\nSpeak Well\\n\\nRULE 22\\n\\n50 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nSo what does speaking well mean? Am I suggesting you walk\\naround with a snooty voice and say “hice” instead of “house”\\nand “creche” instead of “crash”? Of course not. You can keep\\nyour regional accent; that’s not the problem. Look at why we\\nspeak—it is to communicate, to convey information—rather\\nthan how we speak. Speaking well means getting information\\nacross clearly and effectively. It doesn’t matter how you speak,\\nbut it does matter that you speak clearly. And speaking clearly\\nmeans just that—clearly. The things you must avoid are\\n\\n• Mumbling—For obvious reasons, people can’t hear or\\nunderstand you.\\n\\n• Speaking too softly or quietly—Again, people can’t hear\\nyou.\\n\\n• Using jargon—It’s unintelligible to others outside your\\ndepartment or field of expertise.\\n\\n• Any sort of speaking that identifies you with a particular\\ngroup or social class—i.e. youth (trying to use the latest\\ntrendy slang or catchphrase), or politically extreme (radi-\\ncal anything, politically correct gone mad, ecologist,\\nvegetarian, or environmentally obsessive), or too obvi-\\nously belonging to any class system (too poor, too rich,\\ntoo regional).\\n\\n• Speaking badly—using “less” when you really mean\\n“fewer”—that sort of thing. If you don’t know the differ-\\nence, get a grammar book and learn it by heart. Don’t use\\nverbal mannerisms such as “you know” or “like.” Always\\nfinish your sentences.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are four key words to remember to get you speaking\\nwell:\\n\\n• Bright\\n\\n• Clear\\n\\n• Pleasant\\n\\n• Simple\\n\\nThat’s all you need to know. If you use these four, you won’t\\ngo wrong, and people will remember what you say and be\\nimpressed by your clear, bright speaking voice. Speaking well\\nmakes an impact. If you slouch in and mumble your name,\\npeople will assume you are underconfident, ill at ease, and\\nbarely human—and thus quickly forget you. If you walk in\\nconfidently, say your name clearly and with confidence,\\npeople will assume you know where you are going, who you\\nare, and what you want—and thus remember you. Speak\\nsimply—say directly what it is you want to say and nothing\\nmore.\\n\\nRULE 22\\n\\n51K N O W T H AT Y O U’R E B E I N G J U D G E D AT A L L T I M E S\\n\\nSPEAKING WELL MEANS\\n\\nGETTING INFORMATION\\n\\nACROSS CLEARLY AND\\n\\nEFFECTIVELY.\\n\\n\\n\\nWrite Well\\n\\nRULE 23\\n\\n52 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nWe write for two purposes. We write for others to read, and\\nwe write for ourselves to read. How you write for yourself is\\nimmaterial. You can scribble illegible shorthand or write like a\\nfive-year-old. It doesn’t matter, just so long as no one else sees\\nit. But how you write for others to read is of utmost and cru-\\ncial importance. You will be judged on:\\n\\n• What you write\\n\\n• How your writing looks\\n\\nAh, but you say you don’t write anything; you type everything.\\nFine. So what typeface do you choose, and why? What point\\nsize, and why? And you must have to sign documents—that’s\\nwriting. Your signature is as open to judgment as anything\\nelse. I was once told that my signature was that of a very\\nwealthy person. Good, although completely wrong, but it did\\nindicate that I was getting close to the image I wanted to por-\\ntray. A final point on this: always make your signature\\nbig—big signature, big person.\\n\\nIf you use handwriting a lot, then it needs to be\\n\\n• Legible—It must be able to be read by everyone—or there\\nsimply is no point doing it and it is discourteous not to\\nmake the effort.\\n\\n• Neat—No crossings out, all lines equal, that sort of thing.\\n\\n• Stylish—A bit of a flourish here and there.\\n\\n• Mature—Rounded letters and joined up.\\n\\n• Consistent—The writing at the bottom of the page should\\nlook like the writing at the top of the page.\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch your margins and the slope of your writing. You may\\nnot know it but margins—or signatures or any form of writ-\\ning—that slope down towards the right of the page indicate a\\ndepressed person. Optimists slant upwards.\\n\\nMake sure your spelling is correct and your grammar ade-\\nquate—if not, study on it.\\n\\nIf you type a lot, use Times New Roman or Arial, 12 point,\\nand only use italics or bold or underlining sparingly. Never\\nmix typefaces—it betrays you as an unstable, immature per-\\nsonality, apparently—or point size.

If you don’t, then the prob-\\nability is that you’ll end up going nowhere. Smart followers of\\nThe Rules know exactly where they’re going. They have a plan.\\nThey have plotted the path to where they want to be—in six\\nmonths, in a year, in five years. They’ve planned their game\\nand know how to play. And so will you. Rules Players remain\\nflexible and convert their plan according to circumstances—\\nthey’re not rigid thinkers but smart and very fluid.\\n\\n57H AV E A P L A N\\n\\n\\n\\nRULE 24\\n\\n58 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nSo what’s your game plan for your life? Don’t know? Haven’t\\never thought about it? Most people don’t. And that’s why they\\nfail. If you don’t have a plan, it is terribly easy not to stick to it\\nand end up where the current takes you—a bit of flotsam\\nadrift on the eddies of life. Very sad. The Rules Player has a\\nplan—long term and short term.\\n\\nLong-term plans can be very simple—qualify, move up, reach\\nthe top, retire, die. Or they can be sensible and useful. If you\\nintend to have a career, it makes sense to study the game plan\\nof your chosen industry. Obviously, you will have to build in a\\ncertain contingency for the unexpected and the “out-of-your-\\ncontrol,”  but the shrewd Rules Player will have already\\namended their long-term game plan well in advance having\\nseen the indicators and read the signs. I spoke to someone\\nrecently who said, “Who would have predicted downsizing\\nthen?” The answer is anyone with the brains to have seen\\nwhich way their business sector was going.\\n\\nSo, study your chosen industry and see the progression steps\\nneeded to make it to the position you want to occupy. Work\\nout what you need to make those steps. Work out how many\\nsteps it takes—usually no more than about four—junior,\\nmiddle, senior, executive. (If you think otherwise, don’t write\\nin.)\\n\\nWork out what you want from each step—gaining experience,\\nhandling responsibility, learning new skills, acquiring people\\nmanagement understanding, that sort of thing. You will notice\\nthat “increasing my earnings” just isn’t an option here—that is\\na foregone conclusion if you are a Rules Player anyway.\\n\\nKnow What You Want Long Term\\n\\n\\n\\nWork out how each step is made. This might be a transfer to\\nanother department, relocation to another branch, being\\noffered a partnership, being invited to join the board, moving\\nto another company, that sort of thing. Once you know how\\neach step is made, it doesn’t take much to work out what you\\nneed to acquire that how.\\n\\nYou have to have an end game—the final goal. This can be as\\nhigh or as extreme as you like—emperor of the world, prime\\nminister, CEO, wealthiest person in the world, whatever. It is\\na dream and thus has no limits. If you set limits on your imag-\\nination, then you will have to settle for less than the best, less\\nthan perfect, less than you deserve. Ah, but you say we have to\\nbe realistic. Fine. Do that—be realistic. But Rules Players head\\nfor the very utmost of their dreams, and nothing less than the\\ntop is good enough.\\n\\nRULE 24\\n\\n59H AV E A P L A N\\n\\nIF  YOU DON’T HAVE A\\n\\nPLAN, IT  IS TERRIBLY EASY\\n\\nNOT TO STICK TO IT AND\\n\\nEND UP WHERE THE\\n\\nCURRENT TAKES YOU.\\n\\n\\n\\nKnow What You Want Short Term\\n\\nRULE 25\\n\\n60 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nHow short is short term? That’s entirely up to you. I have\\nthree short-term plans on the go—this month, this year, five\\nyears. This seems to provide me with sufficient information to\\nplan my workload. It also allows me to work in, in the short\\nterm, plans that affect my family. I can allow for vacations,\\nchanges of school, garden/house projects and birthdays,\\nChristmas, that sort of thing.\\n\\nYour one-month short-term plan should obviously list current\\nwork projects—deadlines, prioritized tasks, basic routines.\\nThis is for work actually being carried out.\\n\\nYour one-year plan should have projects that are being formu-\\nlated, planned, presented, whatever. This is for work being\\nplanned rather than executed.\\n\\nYour five-year plan should be for ideas, dreams, goals, wishes,\\nwants; it is for work you intend executing one day.\\n\\nYour long-term plan will have a career path built into it. Your\\nfive-year plan will take into it any steps you need to carry out\\nthat long-term plan.\\n\\nI tend to keep three separate records for these three short-term\\nplans. My one-month plan is kept on a clipboard on the desk.\\nIt contains a single sheet that lists boxes for deadlines, return\\nphone calls, things to do. I suppose it’s a bit like a calendar but\\nwithout daily entries.\\n\\nMy one-year plan lives on the wall. It isn’t a wall chart or year\\nplanner but, again, a single sheet with 12 boxes. In each box is\\na month with the relevant info of what I want to do during\\nthat time. It is what I want to do rather than what I have to do.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is a short-term plan, not a to-do list or a calendar or a work\\nschedule. As I am freelance, I have to generate work. This\\nwork—being done during my one-month plan or being gener-\\nated during my one-year plan—is my bread and butter. It is\\nmade up of projects I want to do and projects I have to do.\\nThe ones I have to do are the bread and the ones I want to do\\nare the butter—such as this book, which has been a delight to\\nplan and write. My five-year plan is for my general direction—\\nwhat sort of work do I want to be doing over the next five\\nyears? Your short-term plan will include work you have to do,\\nbut it will be mainly for work you want to do. The shorter the\\nterm, the more likely it is to read like your work schedule and\\nless like a wish list.\\n\\nAll plans should include practical steps to put into action and\\nmake them happen. Otherwise they aren’t “plans” but vague\\nideas.\\n\\nWithin any of these plans, you have to build a contingency.\\nSomeone phones you with a project; you can’t turn it down on\\nthe basis that it isn’t in your plan. You have to be flexible.\\n\\nRULE 25\\n\\n61H AV E A P L A N\\n\\nALL PLANS SHOULD\\n\\nINCLUDE PRACTICAL\\n\\nSTEPS TO PUT INTO\\n\\nACTION AND MAKE \\n\\nTHEM HAPPEN.\\n\\n\\n\\nStudy the Promotion System\\n\\nRULE 26\\n\\n62 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nWhen you start your career, it is at the lowest level, and you\\ngaze upward at the boss, the manager, the managing director,\\nwith reverence and awe. One day, inevitably, you will age, gain\\nexperience, and ascend to greater heights yourself. Either that\\nor maybe start up on your own. And for most people that’s\\nabout it. Career-wise they meander vaguely upward, often get-\\nting sidetracked and stopping at a level where they seem\\ncomfortable, coasting, happy. And that’s it. Career over. Game\\nover. Very sad. Unless that’s really what you want. And if\\nyou’re a committed Rules Player, I doubt it.\\n\\nThe Rules Player never meanders or arrives anywhere vaguely.\\nYou plan. You know the system and use it. You understand the\\nsteps to be taken to get you from A to B and onward and\\nupward all the way to Z.\\n\\nYou have to study the promotion system if you are to enter it\\nand profit from it. It is simply no use waiting for something to\\nturn up, or for fate to take a hand and propel you upward by\\nluck or chance. You have to seize the day and make your own\\nluck. You have to know exactly how to avoid all clichés and\\nelevate yourself within the system. \\n\\nSo, what is the promotion system within your industry? Do\\nyou know it? Have you studied it? Study the background of\\nothers who have been there before you. If not, chances are you\\nare relying on luck to get you somewhere. This may be fine,\\nand it may get you where you want to be, but it is unreliable—\\nbit like playing the lottery in the hope it’ll make you rich and\\nyou can retire. It might happen, but it’s not likely.\\n\\n\\n\\nMaking a promotion chart:\\n\\n• Within your industry look upward to the most senior\\nposition that can be held (or the highest you could possi-\\nbly expect yourself to aim for—they should really be the\\nsame thing—mark this).\\n\\n• Now look at the lowest—mark this.\\n\\n• Now plot all the steps in-between.\\n\\n• Now mark your own place.\\n\\n• Now list the steps needed to get there.\\n\\nYou now have your own promotion chart and can cross off\\neach step as you make it.\\n\\n(The same principle of steps also works if you decide that\\nrather than ascend where you are, you’d like to go up on your\\nown and be entrepreneurial rather than corporate.)\\n\\nWhile you are doing this, you can also list all the skills/experi-\\nence, etc. that you would need for each step to be made\\nsuccessfully. Next to this, you can add what you have to do to\\nacquire these—where you must go, what you have to learn,\\nwhat you need to study. You can add these back into your\\nlong-term plan and your five-year plan.\\n\\nRULE 26\\n\\n63H AV E A P L A N\\n\\nYOU HAVE TO SEIZE THE\\n\\nDAY AND MAKE YOUR OWN\\n\\nLUCK.\\n\\n\\n\\nDevelop a Game Plan\\n\\nRULE 27\\n\\n64 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nDeveloping a game plan is a bit like an actor choosing a part\\nand learning their script. Your game plan has to be who you\\nare going to be. Not many people choose consciously to be a\\nloser, but that’s where they end up. Don’t let it happen to you.\\nAnd it doesn’t happen, once you seize the initiative and\\ndevelop a game plan.\\n\\nYour game plan is a sort of personal mission statement. It is\\ndifferent from setting objectives, which is how to be the\\nperson your game plan decides you are.\\n\\nSo who are you going to be? Successful? A failure? Someone\\nwho gives up? Someone who picks themselves up, dusts them-\\nselves off, and starts all over again? A brilliant career\\nstrategist? A loser? None of these?\\n\\nObviously, you could decide to be ruthless, unpleasant, cruel,\\nvindictive, but we assume you won’t—a Rules Player is never\\nany of these. Your game plan should include your qualities as\\nwell as what sort of game you want to plan—“I will be suc-\\ncessful and still be a thoroughly nice person.”\\n\\nNot many people sit down and consciously carry out this\\nexercise. It may seem simple, but it is an essential tool to get\\nyou to where you want to be. If more people did this, they\\nwouldn’t end up as idiots, or the office bore, or a gossip, or\\nfrighteningly callous in their dealings with their colleagues. If\\nwe all had to sit down and write our game plan—and then live\\nby it—we might all end up as nicer people. There is no bad\\nkarma in trying your hardest to be pleasant, cooperative, help-\\nful, friendly, kind, and honest in your dealings with others\\naround you. Who would sit down and write, “I am going to be\\n\\n\\n\\na complete and utter bastard and harm as many people as I\\ncan, be disliked by everyone, and generally make myself as\\nunpopular as possible”? Yes, no one would write it, but I’ve\\nworked with quite a few who live by it as a game plan. Yes,\\nthey may be successful, but how do they sleep at night? How\\ndo they live with themselves? \\n\\nI once worked with a fairly senior manager whose technique\\nwas to arrive, walk through the department, bawl out as many\\npeople as he could, go to his office, put his feet up with a\\ncoffee for half an hour and then walk back again being as nice\\nas pie to everyone. When I questioned him about this, he said,\\n“It keeps them on their toes. They never know where they are\\nwith me.” He was genuinely disliked by everyone, feared by\\nmost, and commanded zero respect from his peers. Good\\ngame plan. Not.\\n\\nRULE 27\\n\\n65H AV E A P L A N\\n\\nNOT MANY PEOPLE\\n\\nCHOOSE CONSCIOUSLY TO\\n\\nBE A LOSER,  BUT THAT’S\\n\\nWHERE THEY END UP.\\n\\n\\n\\nSet Objectives\\n\\nRULE 28\\n\\n66 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nAn objective is a simple one-sentence mission statement that\\nyou can use to get you through your day. It is almost impossi-\\nble to be successful or to get promoted if you don’t set\\nobjectives.\\n\\nAn objective outlines the key important ingredients in your\\nwork recipe. Suppose you have a meeting to go to. Now we all\\nhate meetings—they are interminable, boring, unproductive,\\ncounter-productive—and an endless source of irritation and\\nargument. You know that Stephen from accounts is going to\\nbe there and will endeavor—usually successfully—to wind\\nyou up. You know you’ll get sidetracked and end up dis-\\ncussing the relocation to Swindon when it doesn’t even affect\\nyour department. You know you’ll end up discussing budgets\\nfor the exhibition stand when that’s six months away and it\\nhasn’t even been decided that you’re going to take a stand at\\nthe NEC this year. So, set an objective:\\n\\n“I will speak only on matters I know about and under-\\nstand and are relevant to me at this meeting, and no\\nmatter what Stephen does, I shall not rise to the bait.”\\n\\nGood. Now stick to it.\\n\\nSuppose you have to present a report to the Finance\\nCommittee about the new costs of the wildflower meadow to\\ngo in front of head office’s new buildings. You know the\\nFinance Committee can waffle on for hours about irrelevant\\ntopics such as whether it is better to have oxeye daises or\\nmarsh buttercups, and all you need to do is present them with\\nthe cost of seeds, mowing equipment, and haymaking provi-\\nsions without getting caught up in the minutiae of which\\n\\n\\n\\nflower is most attractive in spring. So, set an objective:\\n\\n“I will present my report and, once comments have been\\nmade, will make my excuses and leave. If the committee\\ninsist on discussing matters that are irrelevant to my being\\nthere I shall assertively point this out and leave.”\\n\\nGood. Now stick to it.\\n\\nUse an objective for every area of your working life. Objectives\\ntake but seconds, but they do help highlight\\n\\n• What is wrong\\n\\n• Solutions to what is wrong\\n\\n• Action to be taken to correct what is wrong\\n\\n• Ways to prevent the problem recurring\\n\\nRULE 28\\n\\n67H AV E A P L A N\\n\\nIT  IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE\\n\\nTO BE SUCCESSFUL OR TO\\n\\nGET PROMOTED IF YOU\\n\\nDON’T SET OBJECTIVES.\\n\\n\\n\\nKnow Your Role\\n\\nRULE 29\\n\\n68 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nWhat is your role? I know you are there to do a job, carry out\\na function, perform certain tasks, follow set procedures, and\\nall that. But what is your role? This is a bit like setting a game\\nplan. A game plan outlines what sort of working person you\\nare going to be. A role is what sort of facilitator you will be.\\nWill you be an ideas person? A moderator? A communicator?\\nA diplomat?

Basically, your role is\\nhow you fit into the team—and yes, we are all team players;\\nwe have to be in this day and age.\\n\\nDr. Meredith Belbin has spent over 20 years researching the\\nnature of team work to improve people’s strengths. He has\\nidentified nine distinct team roles:\\n\\n• Plant—They are original thinkers; they generate new\\nideas; they offer solutions to problems; they think in radi-\\ncally different ways, laterally, imaginatively.\\n\\n• Resource Investigator—They are creative; they like to\\ntake ideas and run with them; they are extroverted and\\npopular.\\n\\n• Coordinator—They are highly disciplined and controlled;\\nthey can focus on objectives; they unify a team.\\n\\n• Shaper—They are very achievement orientated; they like\\nto be challenged and to get results.\\n\\n• Monitor Evaluator—They analyze and balance and weigh;\\nthey are calm and detached; they are objective thinkers.\\n\\n• Team Worker—They are supportive and cooperative; they\\nmake good diplomats as they only want what is best for\\nthe team.\\n\\n\\n\\n• Implementer—They have good organizational skills; they\\ndisplay common sense; they like to get the job done.\\n\\n• Completer—They check details; they tidy up after them;\\nthey are painstakingly conscientious.\\n\\n• Specialist—They are dedicated to acquiring a specialized\\nskill; they are extremely professional; they have drive and\\ndedication.\\n\\nSo which are you?

A lot of people can’t do this; they\\ncan’t turn the spotlight on themselves objectively enough or\\nbrightly enough to see themselves as others see them. And it’s\\nnot just how others see us; it’s also how we see ourselves. We\\nall carry a mental image of ourselves—what we look like and\\nsound like, what makes us tick; how we work—but how real-\\nistic is this image? I think I work creatively and eccentrically;\\nothers think I am messy and unorganized. Which is true?\\nWhich is the reality?\\n\\nTo know your strengths and weaknesses, you first have to\\nunderstand your role—the way you work. I might see being\\ncreative as a strength—lots of lovely ideas, no attention to\\ndetail, generating new projects rather than seeing them\\nthrough or actually working on them—surely all these are\\nstrengths? Not if I am a Completer or Implementer they’re\\nnot; then they are weaknesses. Instead, my strengths would be\\nperseverance, diligence, stickability, predictability, conformity,\\nsteadfastness, orderliness—yuk, surely these are weaknesses?\\nYou have to know your role before you can make subjective\\njudgments about strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\nIf in doubt, make lists; that’s what I always say. Write down\\nwhat you think are your strengths and weaknesses. Show this\\nlist to a close friend who you do not work with. Ask for their\\nobjective evaluation. Now show it to someone you can trust\\nwho you do work with. Is there a difference in their evaluation\\nof how close to the truth you are? Bet there is quite a \\ndifference. This is because the special skills you bring to\\n\\n\\n\\nfriendships are quite different from the ones you bring to a\\nwork relationship.\\n\\nThis rule is about knowing your strengths and weaknesses; it\\nisn’t necessarily about improving them, eliminating them,\\nworking on them, changing them in any way. What we are is\\nwhat we are, and it is what we have to work with. You may\\nwell be disorganized, erratic, unpredictable—is this good or\\nbad? It all depends on your role. You may need to change your\\nrole to suit your strengths and weaknesses better.\\n\\nA lot of people think that identifying their strengths and\\nweaknesses means they get to lose the bad stuff and only work\\nwith the good stuff. Not true. This isn’t therapy. This is the\\nreal world. We all have weaknesses. The secret trick is learn-\\ning to work with them rather than trying to be perfect, which\\nis unrealistic and unproductive.\\n\\nYou might be able to find better uses for your weaknesses—\\nbut then they would become strengths, wouldn’t they?

In fact,\\nentire books are devoted to threats—mostly from change—\\nsuch as Who Moved My Cheese? and How to Handle Tough\\nSituations at Work. If we can think on our feet, stay out of\\nruts, be flexible and move fast, roll with the punches, and go\\nthe distance, we will not only survive change but we shall also\\nbe contortionists and athletes of the highest order. Of course,\\nwe can’t do all that. There will be times when the threat will\\novertake us and we get squashed. It happens to us all. There is\\nno getting away from the fact that life gets fired at us at point\\nblank range, and we rarely if ever get time to duck.\\n\\nBut a threat is always that. Once it becomes a reality, we can\\ndeal with it. While it is still a threat, it induces fear but can do\\nno harm. Spotting which threat will turn into a reality is the\\nskill. The talent. There are many threats, and we can’t react to\\nall of them. There are fewer realities, and we have to react to\\nthem.\\n\\nIt helps if we don’t see threats as threats, but instead as oppor-\\ntunities. Each threat that becomes a reality is an opportunity\\nto grow and change, adapt and rework our methods and style\\nof management. If our attitude is positive, we tend to see\\nthreats less as a negative thing and more as a positive thing—\\nthey bring us the chance to prove ourselves. If we never get\\nchallenged, we will never improve.\\n\\nI was once employed as a manager by a company that was\\ntaken over. The new bosses brought in their own managers,\\n\\n\\n\\nand three of us were “downgraded”—demoted in other words.\\nWe had no choice—apart from walking out, of course. I was,\\nby this time, a committed Rules Player, so I saw it as an oppor-\\ntunity to prove to the new bosses that I was good enough to\\nbe one of their managers and, three months later, I was back\\nup there. \\n\\nOf the other two, one eventually walked and one stayed\\n“downgraded.” They both bitched and moaned and felt the\\nmove was derogatory and demeaning and an insult. It proba-\\nbly was, but I didn’t need to feel depressed about it. I needed\\nto get back up there—upward and onward.\\n\\nRULE 32\\n\\n75H AV E A P L A N\\n\\nEACH THREAT THAT\\n\\nBECOMES A REALITY IS AN\\n\\nOPPORTUNITY TO GROW\\n\\nAND CHANGE.\\n\\n\\n\\nLook for Opportunities\\n\\nRULE 33\\n\\n76 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nI know I’ve said have a plan—both long term and short\\nterm—but there do come times when plans have to be thrown\\nout of the window. These are the opportunities. I had a friend\\nwho wasn’t getting on particularly fast in his promotion plan.\\nOne day he found himself sharing a compartment on the train\\nwith his chairman. This was his opportunity. He could have\\nfluffed his lines, made a jackass of himself, or been too embar-\\nrassed or nervous to take the advantage. But he didn’t do any\\nof these things. He made his pitch perfectly. All he did was to\\nchat informally but with the respect his chairman warranted;\\nshow a keen grasp of the company’s history, mission state-\\nment, and general aims; be presentable, smart, and well\\nspoken; express himself clearly and articulately; and, most\\nimportantly, didn’t noticeably press his advantage—he knew\\nwhen to shut up and back off. It certainly worked. His depart-\\nment head was told by the chairman that she had a “Smart\\nyoung man there—bring him on a bit, will you?” What choice\\ndid she have but to promote him?\\n\\nThat’s seizing an opportunity. You can’t write that into your\\nplan, and these moments will come along. When they do you\\nmust\\n\\n• Recognize them\\n\\n• Play them well\\n\\n• Be cool and suave\\n\\nWhat you mustn’t do is\\n\\n• Fail to recognize the moment for what it is—a fleeting\\nopportunity\\n\\n\\n\\n• Panic\\n\\n• Over play your hand\\n\\n• Get so excited you make a idiot of yourself\\n\\nLearn to see opportunities as balls—if they get thrown your\\nway, you have but a split second to catch them. There is no\\ntime for asking questions, looking over your shoulder, weigh-\\ning the pros and cons, or dancing the foxtrot. You either catch\\nthe ball or you don’t.\\n\\nSpend a little time looking back at what opportunities you\\nhave missed—and what you would do if you had the same\\nchance a second time. Would you react differently now? What\\ndid you do wrong? \\n\\nRULE 33\\n\\n77H AV E A P L A N\\n\\nLEARN TO SEE\\n\\nOPPORTUNITIES AS\\n\\nBALLS—IF THEY GET\\n\\nTHROWN YOUR WAY,  \\n\\nYOU HAVE BUT A SPLIT\\n\\nSECOND TO \\n\\nCATCH THEM.\\n\\n\\n\\nMake Learning a Lifelong Mission\\n\\nRULE 34\\n\\n78 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nI met a guy once who came from a very poor background and\\nwas unable to take his education as far as he’d have liked. He\\nleft school at 14 and ended up working all his life as a customs\\nofficer, working his way up to a middle management role.\\nWhen he retired at 65, he decided that at last he could afford\\nto get the education he’d always wanted. So he got a law\\ndegree, did his training, and qualified as a barrister at the age\\nof about 70. How many of us would have the attitude to learn-\\ning you need to do that? (Never mind the energy!)\\n\\nWhen you watch kids learn, you can see how much they enjoy\\nit. Not when it’s boring rote learning with tedious teachers, of\\ncourse, but when they’re inspired and motivated they couldn’t\\nbe happier. Well, you and I still have the same brain we had\\nwhen we were kids. OK, we may have lost a few little grey\\ncells, but we can still enjoy learning. And if we don’t keep\\nlearning, we stagnate and become boring old stick-in-the-\\nmuds. If you don’t learn, you can’t change, and if you aren’t\\nchanging, what’s the point of being here?\\n\\nSo, make it your express purpose to keep learning. I know a\\nteacher in Scotland who dreamed as a child of becoming a\\nspaceman—like most of his school friends no doubt. However,\\nhe did something about it and, instead of allowing everyday\\nlife to get in the way of his aim, he lifted his head and made a\\npoint of learning and developing. \\n\\nAs a result, he won a scholarship to the U.S. Space and Rocket\\nCenter in Alabama for a week’s intensive space training, com-\\nplete with zero-gravity exercises and simulated shuttle\\ntake-offs. How cool is that? After that he could pursue his\\n\\n\\n\\ndream of taking this knowledge and passing it onto the pupils\\nhe now teaches. All because he approached life as an ongoing\\nlesson.\\n\\nWe can all learn* from people like him. Remember what it was\\nthat inspired you as a child? Or consider the new things that\\nhave grabbed your interest since. Learning new skills for work\\nis valuable, from another language to new computer software.\\nBut any learning keeps your mind open and free and exercised,\\nwhich will benefit your work and your employer. So, whatever\\nit is that excites you, go on—make it your aim to learn more\\nabout it.\\n\\nRULE 34\\n\\n79H AV E A P L A N\\n\\nIF  YOU DON’T LEARN, YOU\\n\\nCAN’T CHANGE, AND IF\\n\\nYOU AREN’T CHANGING,\\n\\nWHAT’S THE POINT OF\\n\\nBEING HERE?\\n\\n* And if we do, we’ll be following this Rule already\\n\\n\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank \\n\\n\\n\\nPART IV\\n\\nIF YOU \\nCAN’T SAY \\nANYTHING\\n\\nNICE—\\nSHUT UP\\n\\n\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank \\n\\n\\n\\nThese are really easy Rules to understand but tough to follow.\\nWe all like to gossip, to bitch, to talk about our boss behind\\nher back. The Rule, however, is—don’t do it. Learn to say only\\npositive things, nice things, complimentary things. People\\njudge you by what you say as much as how you say it, so be\\nknown as someone who is always pleasant and upbeat.\\n\\n83I F Y O U C A N’T S AY A N Y T H I N G N I C E—S H U T U P\\n\\n\\n\\nRULE 35\\n\\n84 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\n“Did you know that at the last company conference Steve,\\nfrom accounts, was seen coming out of Debbie’s, from mar-\\nketing, bedroom in the early hours of Sunday morning?\\nAnd that twice since they have been seen in Luigi’s at\\nlunchtime, and Kathy swears she’s seen them holding hands\\nin the lift. Steve’s married, you know, and I thought Debbie\\nwas engaged. What do you think? Should they be carrying\\non like this?”\\n\\nAnswer: “What’s this got to do with me?”\\n\\nGood, it has nothing to do with you, unless Steve happens to\\nbe your boss and his work is being affected, or you happen to\\nbe Debbie’s fiancé. This Rule says that you don’t gossip. It\\ndoesn’t say you don’t listen. You may find it interesting, and\\nknowing what’s going on comes in useful sometimes. But there\\nis one part of this Rule that is really, really simple—don’t pass\\nanything on. That’s it. Gossip stops with you. If you listen but\\ndon’t pass it along or offer an opinion, you’ll be seen as “one of\\nus” rather than a party pooper. You don’t have to be seen \\ndisapproving—merely don’t pass anything along.\\n\\nGossiping is the occupation of idle minds—those who haven’t\\ngot enough work to do. It is also the domain of workers who\\nhave mindless jobs to do—jobs they can do without thinking\\nand thus have to occupy themselves with inane chatter,\\nrumors, lies, and malicious stories. Trouble is that if you don’t\\njoin in, you can be seen as severe or stuck-up. You have to\\nlook as if you gossip without ever doing it. Don’t go getting all\\nself-righteous and telling everyone how silly they are doing it. \\n\\nDon’t Gossip\\n\\n\\n\\nWith most things, discretion is the key word. Don’t be seen\\ndisapproving—just don’t do it, and keep that to yourself.\\n\\nTHERE IS ONE PART OF\\n\\nTHIS RULE THAT IS\\n\\nREALLY,  REALLY SIMPLE—\\n\\nDON’T PASS ANYTHING ON.\\n\\nRULE 35\\n\\n85I F Y O U C A N’T S AY A N Y T H I N G N I C E—S H U T U P\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t Bitch\\n\\nRULE 36\\n\\n86 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nYep, life ain’t fair. Sometimes colleagues shirk and you end up\\nwith extra work; bosses can be ill prepared for their jobs and\\nas such are incompetent and often inconsistent; idiots get pro-\\nmoted all around you; there’s too much work to do; there are\\ntoo many stupid systems in place; idiots thwart you at every\\nturn. It’s true—life’s a bitch.\\n\\nNow tell me how moaning helps in any one of these scenarios.\\nTell me how moaning will change one single thing. It won’t. It\\ndoesn’t. Moaning is a time-wasting device invented by sad\\npeople who haven’t enough work to do. And they’re usually\\nthe ones standing next to the ones gossiping. They may even\\nbe the same ones—chances are they are. And when they’ve\\nfinished having a good moan, they’ll have a good gossip.\\n\\nMoaning is pointless. It is unproductive and achieves nothing.\\nAll it does is\\n\\n• Identifies you as idle, petty, trivial\\n\\n• Encourages you to turn the corners of your mouth\\ndown—not attractive\\n\\n• Wastes time\\n\\n• Makes you a magnet for other moaners\\n\\n• Gets you a reputation as someone who doesn’t offer any-\\nthing productive or helpful\\n\\n• Demotivates you and sets up a vicious circle\\n\\nSo, what are you going to do if you are a habitual moaner?\\nEasy, make sure that whenever you do moan you make your-\\nself offer a solution to whatever it is you are moaning about. If\\n\\n\\n\\nyou can’t see a solution, you aren’t allowed to moan. Try that\\nfor a few weeks, and you’ll stop moaning quite naturally.\\n\\nBitching about others invariably takes place behind their\\nbacks. Next time you feel the need for a good bitch about\\nsomeone, make yourself go and do it to their face. If they\\naren’t present in the room, don’t do it. Simple Rule, but it\\nworks. Once they are there, you’ll stop bitching; it’s too hard\\nto keep doing it when you’ve upset everyone in the office. If\\nyou’ve got something to say, say it to their face (but do see the\\nintroduction to this Rule first—If you can’t say anything nice—\\nshut up).\\n\\nRULE 36\\n\\n87I F Y O U C A N’T S AY A N Y T H I N G N I C E—S H U T U P\\n\\nMOANING IS POINTLESS.  \\n\\nIT  IS UNPRODUCTIVE AND\\n\\nACHIEVES NOTHING.\\n\\n\\n\\nCompliment People Sincerely\\n\\nRULE 37\\n\\n88 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nThe key to this Rule is “sincerely.” You mustn’t use compli-\\nments glibly, falsely, shallowly, dishonestly, or disingenuously.\\nCompliments must be real, honest, open, guileless and mean-\\ningful.\\n\\nBeing the sort of person who gives compliments is quite tricky.\\nYou don’t want to be seen as a slimeball or spooky—and\\npeople who do give compliments can often end up seen like\\nthis—but you do want to come across as genuinely warm and\\nfriendly.\\n\\nSo how to do this? And why? Well, if you do it affably, it\\nmakes people think incredibly well about you—it is good\\noffice karma. The best way to do it is by being unsophisticated\\nabout it. All you have to do is say, “I really like the way you’ve\\nhad your hair cut,” and then ask a question about whatever it\\nis you are complimenting her on, and make it about how it\\nwas done. “So who did your hair?”\\n\\n“I do like the way you handled that customer; how did you\\nfeel saying that?”\\n\\n“I must say I liked your report; how is it going down with\\nthe board?”\\n\\nTry to avoid using over-the-top expressions. You don’t love\\ntheir new coat—you merely “like” it. Remember, if you “love”\\nit, you’ll want to marry it and have its babies. Not true of a\\ncoat, or a report, or a hair style, or the way someone handles a\\ncustomer.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you “like” something, feel free to say so. You can emphasize\\nhow much you like something by\\n\\n• “I really like …”\\n\\n• “I do like …”\\n\\n• “Can I tell you how much I liked …?”\\n\\n• And it doesn’t just have to be “liked,” although it is a very\\ngood one to start with\\n\\n• “I was impressed by …”\\n\\n• “I thought you did really well …”\\n\\n• “The way you did … was very good indeed”\\n\\n• “I did enjoy your presentation. It was really rather \\nexceptional.”\\n\\nWhen giving compliments, make sure you can’t be accused of\\nflirting or coming on to someone—keep it professional and/or\\nwork related. I’m sure you don’t need telling this.\\n\\nRULE 37\\n\\n89I F Y O U C A N’T S AY A N Y T H I N G N I C E—S H U T U P\\n\\nBEING THE SORT OF\\n\\nPERSON WHO GIVES\\n\\nCOMPLIMENTS IS QUITE\\n\\nTRICKY.\\n\\n\\n\\nStand Up for Others\\n\\nRULE 38\\n\\n90 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nSo, you’re all sitting round having coffee when the subject of\\nyoung Adam comes up. Now we all know that Adam is a pain\\nin the backside. He doesn’t pull his weight, goofs off, steals the\\npens and paperclips, is rude to the security staff, always off-\\nloads as much work onto others as possible, blames others for\\nhis mistakes, and is generally obnoxious. So you all have a\\nmoan about him behind his back, and get a lot of your anger\\nabout his behaviour off your chest. But you don’t. Oh, the\\nothers might but you won’t, not from now on. You are now a\\nRules Player, and you stand up for others.\\n\\nNo matter how obnoxious young Adam is, you will always\\nfind something nice—and genuine—to say about him. That is\\nyour objective—find something nice to say no matter what.\\n\\nAt first this may be quite hard, but if you persevere it becomes\\nincreasingly easy—it’s all a question of habit and mental out-\\nlook. If we are used to bitching and moaning, then that’s what\\nwe do. But if we change our approach, we can be more posi-\\ntive—though it does take a bit of effort initially to make this\\nchange.\\n\\nStanding up for others, no matter what, gets you a reputation\\nas someone who can always find something nice to say about\\neverybody. Thus, those who you would have moaned about\\nknow that you, of all the work force, will always be fighting\\ntheir corner for them. It gets you unwritten loyalty and a sort\\nof guardian angel relationship with the more unpopular mem-\\nbers of the team.\\n\\nThis is a strange relationship to have, but it works wonders—\\nthese are the people who will back you in an emergency. They\\n\\n\\n\\nwill let you know if someone is trying to mess you up. They\\nwill pull out all the stops for you because they know you care.\\nIf you need a favor, they will be the ones to call on.\\n\\nIt’s amazing how quickly the word will spread that you are a\\nthoroughly nice person—you don’t bitch, you don’t moan, you\\nstand up for the underdog, you are supportive, and you can\\nalways see at least one good point in a thoroughly bad apple.\\n\\nObviously, you will have to do this in an honest and sincere\\nfashion—it’s no good lying or making it up. If you, at first,\\nsimply can’t find anything positive to say, then shut up. But\\nthere is always something nice to say—nobody is completely\\nevil or wicked or nasty.\\n\\nSo, back to young Adam. What are you going to say? Well, for\\na start you could point out that he makes good coffee. Or that\\nhe is always on time. Or he is very good at handling irate cus-\\ntomers. Or he has a brilliant sense of humor. Or he always\\nknows the football scores. Just keep saying “But he’s good\\nbecause he …”\\n\\nRULE 38\\n\\n91I F Y O U C A N’T S AY A N Y T H I N G N I C E—S H U T U P\\n\\nIT  GETS YOU UNWRITTEN\\n\\nLOYALTY AND A SORT OF\\n\\nGUARDIAN ANGEL\\n\\nRELATIONSHIP WITH THE\\n\\nMORE UNPOPULAR\\n\\nMEMBERS OF THE TEAM.\\n\\n\\n\\nBe Cheerful and Positive\\n\\nRULE 39\\n\\n92 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nIf you go into work each morning with a positive vibe, it sets\\nyou up as the sort of person to whom stress and troubles and\\nproblems are but as water off a duck’s back. You thus get a rep-\\nutation as being someone who is in control, smooth, relaxed,\\nconfident, and very mature. And all for the sake of a few bars\\nof “Moon River,” whistled as you make your way to your desk.\\n\\nBe cheerful at all times. So it’s raining out there and it’s a dark\\nand depressing winter’s afternoon. Business is slack, interest\\nrates have just gone up again and the boss is in a foul mood,\\nand everyone’s keeping their heads down. It’s still no reason to\\nlose your smile. So it’s a bad day; this too will pass, and the\\nsun will come back. Whatever your situation, things will\\nalways get better.\\n\\nMaintaining a cheerful and positive outlook is a trick. At first\\nyou don’t have to believe it—just do it. Act it. Pretend. But do\\nit. After a little while you’ll find it isn’t an act, you’re not pre-\\ntending, you genuinely do feel cheerful. It’s a trick. You are\\ntricking yourself, no one else. Putting on a smile triggers hor-\\nmones. These hormones will make you feel better. Once you\\nfeel better, you will smile more and thus produce more hor-\\nmones. All it takes is the first few days smiling when you don’t\\nfeel like it, and you will start a cycle going that will make you\\nfeel better all the time.\\n\\nOnce you are seen as someone cheerful and positive, people\\nwill want to hang out with you more—there is nothing so\\nattractive as a cheerful person.\\n\\n\\n\\nBring some flowers into work and brighten up your desk.\\nWhistle. Smile. Laugh. Never reveal that you feel like the pits\\ninside. It’s all too easy when someone says, “How are you?” to\\nreply “Oh, OK, I guess, can’t complain, mustn’t grumble, you\\nknow, struggling on.” It’s a cliché. It’s a habit. Try instead,\\n“Fine, really good actually, doing OK.” There’s a trick for you.\\n\\nSo someone brings you more work that you simply have to\\ndo—it’s unavoidable and part of your remit, and just when\\nyou thought you could see a little light at the end of the\\ntunnel. Easy to say, “Oh no, not more bloody work. Can’t\\neverybody see how busy I am? This really is too much.” If it’s\\nunavoidable and moaning isn’t going to change a thing, then\\nmaybe saying, “Fine, just dump it there; I’ll get on with it in a\\nmoment. Thanks.” Why berate the messenger? I’m sure he\\ndidn’t personally generate all this extra work just to piss you\\noff. So it’s a drag having extra work to do. So what? So be\\ncheerful and get on with it. Every second spent moaning and\\nbitching is a second taken off your life. Every second spent\\nbeing cheerful and positive is a second added on. Take your\\nchoice.\\n\\nRULE 39\\n\\n93I F Y O U C A N’T S AY A N Y T H I N G N I C E—S H U T U P\\n\\nSO IT’S A BAD DAY;  \\n\\nTHIS TOO WILL PASS,  AND\\n\\nTHE SUN WILL COME BACK.\\n\\n\\n\\nAsk Questions\\n\\nRULE 40\\n\\n94 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nThe object of the exercise is to become:\\n\\n• Popular\\n\\n• Promotable\\n\\n• Successful\\n\\n• Thoroughly nice\\n\\n• Efficient\\n\\nOne of the easiest ways to do this is to learn and practice the\\nhabit of asking questions. What sort of questions? Well, that\\ndepends, obviously on the situation. For instance, in Rule 38:\\nCompliment people sincerely, we used a couple of examples\\nwhere the follow-up question is useful—“I really liked your\\npresentation. I thought you were incredibly calm. How do you\\navoid shaking?” Or—“I like your new method of handling\\ninvoices. What gave you the idea?”\\n\\nAsking questions shows that you have paid attention, care, are\\ninterested, are thoughtful, are considerate and intelligent and\\ncreative. Stupid people don’t ask questions. Bored people don’t\\nask questions. Lazy people don’t ask questions. Any ques-\\ntions?\\n\\nBelligerent people tend to make statements—“I don’t like that\\nidea; it’s unworkable.” Rules Players ask questions; they might\\nmean the same thing, but they handle it differently—“I think I\\nneed more information about this idea. How do you see it\\nworking? Will dispatch be able to handle the increase in\\norders? Can we provide enough extra staff to cover? Maybe we\\nall need to go away and think about this one. What does\\neveryone else think?” You haven’t said the idea stinks, but they\\n\\n\\n\\nknow you think that but they also think you’re a thoroughly\\nnice person—you haven’t shot them down in flames in front\\nof their colleagues, but you have given them enough rope to\\nhang themselves if they want to. And you’ve given them a way\\nout if they choose to take it—go away and think about it a bit\\nmore means let’s not hear about this again, but it’s a terribly\\ndiplomatic way of saying so.\\n\\nAsking questions is a very nice thing to do in a general way. It\\nshows you are interested in your colleagues. But do make the\\nquestions genuine and sincere, worthwhile and kind.\\n\\nThere’s very little point in asking, “Where on earth did you get\\nthat coat? You can’t think it suits you, surely?” Much better\\nnot to dwell on the coat if it really is horrid. Ask instead about\\nthe work: “How come you can always do this invoicing so\\nquickly? Do you have some secret the rest of us don’t have?”\\n\\nAs in the case of standing up for someone—even if they are\\nloathsome, there will always be some good point about a\\nperson; no one is totally wicked—so too with questions. There\\nwill always be some aspect of someone’s work that you could\\nask about or their hobbies or social life or family. Even if it’s a\\nsimple “How are the kids?”, it cuts the ice and makes you\\nnice. It opens up dialogue, generates pleasantness, and creates\\nwarmth among people who have to work together every day.\\n\\nRULE 40\\n\\n95I F Y O U C A N’T S AY A N Y T H I N G N I C E—S H U T U P\\n\\nIT  SHOWS YOU ARE\\n\\nINTERESTED IN YOUR\\n\\nCOLLEAGUES.\\n\\n\\n\\nUse “Please” and “Thank You” \\n\\nRULE 41\\n\\n96 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nYou would have thought this one so obvious, so basic, and so\\nfundamental that surely it can’t be part of the Rules. Sorry, but\\nwe all need reminding that saying “please” and “thank you” is\\nterribly important. It just doesn’t happen enough. People say\\nthat they are too busy or too forgetful, or that it should be\\ntaken as read that they have said them and they don’t need to\\neach and every time. Rubbish. The only reason please and\\nthank you get forgotten is plain old bad manners. If we start\\nignoring even the basic levels of human decency and polite-\\nness, then there really is no point to any of us being here. If\\nwe aren’t civil and civilized enough to thank someone, or to be\\nbothered enough to say “please,” then it really is time to pack\\nit in.\\n\\nIt doesn’t matter how many times a day someone passes you a\\npiece of paper—it is “thank you” every single time without fail\\nor exception. It doesn’t matter how many times you have to\\nask for the same thing—you always say “please.” If someone\\ndoes anything for you, no matter how mundane, trivial, repeti-\\ntive, boring, effortless, you will always say thank you. \\n\\nYou forget one time, and you will be labeled as rude, boorish,\\nand unpleasant. Make someone’s day and don’t forget, please.\\nThank you. I once worked with a manager who could get staff\\nto work the graveyard shift, come in on their holidays, work\\novertime, work their days off, take work home with them,\\nwork on weekends, and work harder than any other manager\\ncould. We all watched him, trying to work out what it was he\\nwas doing that we weren’t. He was getting loyalty from his\\nteam that we weren’t. I know you are ahead of me at this stage\\n\\n\\n\\nand have got your hand up with the answer. He said “please”\\nand “thank you.”\\n\\nYes. Happy now? He did indeed. And that simple bit of polite-\\nness went a long way. I don’t think his staff consciously knew\\nhe did it. We certainly couldn’t spot it for a long time. Most of\\nus reckoned we also said “please” and “thank you.” But he\\nsaid it without fail every single time. And when you say it,\\nmean it. A sincere and warm thank you goes a long way. It is\\nalso a very good way to respond to compliments and praise\\nyourself. If someone says you have done something well, don’t\\nblush and stammer, “It was nothing really.” That subtracts\\nfrom their compliment. Better instead just to say, “Thank\\nyou.” Never use the word “please” to wheedle or cajole. It is\\n“Could you work through this lunchtime, please, as we need\\nextra cover on the phones? I’ll make sure you get the time\\nback a bit later this afternoon.” It is not, “Pleeeeease can you\\nwork, pretty pleeeease.”\\n\\nRULE 41\\n\\n97I F Y O U C A N’T S AY A N Y T H I N G N I C E—S H U T U P\\n\\nA SINCERE AND WARM\\n\\nTHANK YOU GOES A \\n\\nLONG WAY.\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t Swear\\n\\nRULE 42\\n\\n98 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nI know we all do it. I know you think it’s cool. I know we have\\nto be modern and move with the times. But I’m sorry, swearing\\nisn’t allowed. You can say what you want when you get home,\\nor in the car on your own. But at work you don’t swear. It’s a\\nsimple Rule, but it works because it is a default setting—you\\ndon’t swear. Now what decisions and choices do you have to\\nmake about that? Answer: None. None whatsoever. It is your\\nbottom line. You don’t swear, so all the tricky stuff has been\\ntaken away from you. \\n\\nBut if swearing is your default setting, you have so many deci-\\nsions and choices to make, I’m surprised you get any work\\ndone at all. For instance do you:\\n\\n• Swear every time something goes wrong\\n\\n• Swear over the phone\\n\\n• Swear in front of the boss\\n\\n• Swear in front of customers\\n\\n• Swear at customers\\n\\n• Limit yourself to certain swear words and not use others\\n\\n• Use religious blasphemy as swear words\\n\\n• Limit yourself to mild swearing or go for the really \\noffensive\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s a mine field. It’s a nightmare. It really is so much easier to\\njust not bother. This isn’t a puritan dictate. It is an efficiency\\ndictate. It saves time and effort and having to think about it if\\nyou simply don’t do it.

In fact, that probably isn’t\\ngood listening but therapy. A good listener is someone who\\nmakes the speaker know that they are listening. You do this by:\\n\\n• Making encouraging noises—“Hmmm, go on, yes, I’m \\nlistening.”\\n\\n• Displaying appropriate body language—Head tilted to\\none side, eyes open, and looking at the person speaking,\\nnot yawning or fiddling with your watch.\\n\\n• Repeating back some bits to make sure they know you’ve\\ntaken them in— “On Friday at 3, yes, I’ve got that.”\\n\\n• Getting them to repeat things you haven’t heard or under-\\nstood—“Can you repeat that bit about Peterborough? I’m\\nnot sure I was taking that in.”\\n\\n• Asking questions—“So the move to Gloucester will not\\nhappen now?”\\n\\n• Taking notes—Write stuff down as they speak.\\n\\nNow why would you want to be a good listener? I said, now\\nwhy would you want to be a good listener? Easy. You get\\n\\n• More facts\\n\\n• A better understanding of what you are supposed to be\\ndoing\\n\\n• A better grasp of what is going on around you\\n\\n• Seen as sympathetic and considerate\\n\\n• Seen as intelligent and alert\\n\\n• Seen as someone on top of their job\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you don’t listen, you don’t know. If you are going to listen,\\nmake sure they know you are. Easy.\\n\\nGood listening is a skill, a special talent, that you will have to\\npractice and learn. It doesn’t happen overnight, and it isn’t\\nautomatic. You have to think about it and catch yourself when\\nyou aren’t listening and turn it on then.\\n\\nRULE 43\\n\\n101I F Y O U C A N’T S AY A N Y T H I N G N I C E—S H U T U P\\n\\nGOOD LISTENING IS A\\n\\nSKILL,  A SPECIAL TALENT,\\n\\nTHAT YOU WILL HAVE TO\\n\\nPRACTICE AND LEARN.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnly Speak Sense\\n\\nRULE 44\\n\\n102 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nTo become successful and get promoted, you have to project\\nthe right image—the wise, mature, reliable, cool, sophisti-\\ncated, trustworthy, experienced business person—and there\\nare times when all the hard work can be devastated, destroyed,\\nby a careless word or unguarded moment. Recently, a shadow\\ngovernment front-bench minister was sacked because she told\\na “racist” joke at a rugby club dinner. Her career was brought\\ndown by an unguarded moment of not “speaking sense.”\\n\\nYou have to guard your tongue against:\\n\\n• Un-PC comments\\n\\n• Offensive jokes or remarks that alienate any section of the\\ncommunity\\n\\n• Sexism in any form\\n\\n• Patronizing people\\n\\n• Arrogance\\n\\n• Loss of temper\\n\\n• Offensive swearing—see Rule 42\\n\\n• Bitching, moaning, gossiping—see Rules 35, 36, and 37\\n\\n• Revealing what you really think of people\\n\\nIt might be wise to learn to speak only occasionally, rather\\nthan chattering on. If you let your tongue run away with itself,\\nit is so much more likely that you’ll say the wrong thing. If\\nyou think carefully before you speak, pause, and have a\\nchance to bite your tongue, then the chances are that your\\ndelivery will be accurate, your speech edited carefully, and you\\nwill only speak sense. You thus get a reputation for being wise\\n\\n\\n\\nand mature. People will come to you for advice and guidance\\nbecause they know you think about what you are going to say\\nand don’t just chatter on. They will trust you. Once trusted,\\nyou are a natural candidate for promotion and success.\\n\\nMake sure that what you have to say has an impact and isn’t\\nlost in the general hubbub of office clamor. Don’t chat about\\nwhat you watched on TV last night—to be honest no one is\\nreally interested—instead be silent until you have something\\nof import to offer.\\n\\nRULE 44\\n\\n103I F Y O U C A N’T S AY A N Y T H I N G N I C E—S H U T U P\\n\\nTHERE ARE TIMES WHEN\\n\\nALL THE HARD WORK \\n\\nCAN BE DEVASTATED,\\n\\nDESTROYED, BY A\\n\\nCARELESS WORD OR\\n\\nUNGUARDED MOMENT.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank \\n\\n\\n\\nPART V\\n\\nLOOK AFTER\\nYOURSELF\\n\\n\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank \\n\\n\\n\\nMost people you deal with are probably decent and good to be\\naround.

What does your industry do? How much\\na part of that industry are you? Have you considered the ethics\\nof your industry?\\n\\nWhat do we mean by ethics? Ethics are the morals of your\\nindustry—the rights and wrongs, the good and bad. Is your\\nindustry a good thing or a bad thing? Does it hurt or heal? Is\\nit putting something positive into society or merely taking\\nsomething out?\\n\\nNo, you don’t have to walk out if you have just suddenly\\ndecided that your own particular industry stinks. What you\\ncan do is work from the inside to change things. I don’t think\\nwe’re talking environmental issues here, although I am aware\\nthat they may be of concern to a lot of us. Instead, I want you\\nto concentrate on what your industry does morally.\\n\\nObviously, if you do decide that your industry is unjustified in\\nits approach—and this happened to me and I walked—and\\nyou simply cannot live with it, then you have to get out. This\\nis good karma, and you gain benefit even if you do lose out\\nfinancially.\\n\\nWithin your industry there will be good bits and bad bits.\\nOccasionally, you will be asked to cross the line and do bad\\nthings. Obviously, you will have read Rule 47: Set Personal\\nStandards but this is about helping set standards for your\\nindustry rather than personal ones. You have to point out that\\nmorally, ethically, what you are being asked to do is bad for the\\n\\nKnow the Ethics of Your Industry\\n\\n\\n\\ncompany. Constantly say, “What would the press do if they got\\nhold of this?” and offer them a suitable headline: “Scrooge Ltd\\nreplaces sacked workers with Asian sweatshop labor.”\\n\\nYes, you can be as assertive as you like and refuse, but you\\nmight just get labelled then as a wimp who is frightened to get\\nhis hands dirty—no guts, that sort of thing. No, you have to\\npoint out the ramifications for the company. You have to\\nimplant the idea of the whistle blower—“Hey, what would\\nthey do with this?” This way you will be one of the company\\npeople while still playing the ethics card. You will be one of us\\nand one of them all at the same time.\\n\\nTo do all this, you have to know the ethics of your industry\\nand know what its contribution is.

Are you breaking any\\nlaws? Do you know the legalities of your industry?\\n\\nI once worked for an organization that was, initially, remark-\\nably above board. It prided itself on being a standard setter, a\\nnew thing in the industry. After a few years, it suddenly\\nchanged direction and lost the Jekyll to gain the Hyde. It was\\nquite bizarre, and I couldn’t see why it happened. Senior board\\nmembers hadn’t changed that much, and circumstances didn’t\\nseem to demand it—we weren’t fighting for our lives here. But\\nsuddenly laws were being broken—and I do mean laws.\\nSuddenly I found myself working for a crooked and corrupt\\ncompany. What to do? I turned a blind eye for a while, but\\neventually I too was asked to participate in the law breaking. It\\nwas at that point I left. I kept my honor and reputation and\\nwent to work for the opposition, its rival. Once there, I was\\nasked about my old company and what it got up to, but I\\nwouldn’t give any information that would allow my new\\nbosses to gain benefit over my old company. I don’t know why,\\nbut it seemed honorable to sit on what I knew. I was happy to\\ntalk about the way they did business, just so long as it didn’t\\nspill over into this area of legalities.\\n\\nA few years later I found myself working for a company that\\nwas taken over by my old corrupt bunch. By now the com-\\npany had been caught, punished, and cleaned up its act. Did I\\nwant to work for the company again? Not particularly. But I\\ndid have an interview with a senior director who said he was\\nhappy to have me on board—“At least you know how to keep\\nyour mouth shut,” he said. The leopard still seemed a bit\\nspotty to me and I walked.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, how clean is your industry? Your company? You have to\\nknow what you might be asked to do and what is legal and\\nwhat isn’t. Some industries have incredibly minute and trivial\\nlaws that you can run foul of almost without realizing it. But\\nrealize it you must. To be a Rules Player you have to be\\ncleaner than clean, above suspicion, and never allow yourself\\nto be scapegoated into anything. If your company is looking\\nfor a sucker, make sure it ain’t you. Make sure you stay clearly\\nthis side of the line, and don’t stray over it accidentally.\\n\\nIf you choose to break the law, that’s one thing, but how awful\\nit would be if you ended up in prison because you didn’t\\nknow. Better to be an intelligent convict than a stupid one—\\n“But I didn’t know” has never been an effective defense.\\n\\nRULE 46\\n\\n111LO O K A F T E R Y O U R S E L F\\n\\nTO BE A RULES PLAYER\\n\\nYOU HAVE TO BE CLEANER\\n\\nTHAN CLEAN.\\n\\n\\n\\nSet Personal Standards\\n\\nRULE 47\\n\\n112 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nDo you sleep nights?

It\\nsets a limit that you don’t have to think about. Never lie means\\nexactly that—never lie. Under no circumstances do you lie.\\nOnce you have got a reputation as someone who never lies,\\nyou won’t ever be asked to cover up, or cover for anyone else.\\n\\nIf you do decide to lie for a living, you have too many choices\\nand decisions. Where do you draw the line? Do you only tell\\nlittle lies? Great big ones? Do you lie to save yourself? Others?\\nDo you lie for the company? For your boss? For colleagues?\\nHow developed will your lies be? Will you add lie to lie when\\nthe first lie looks like it’s about to be detected? Where will you\\nstop this process? Will you involve other people in your lies?\\nOr will you be a lone liar?\\n\\nCan you see the problems? If you have a simple Rule—never\\nlie—you have a default setting that requires no thought, \\nno choices, no decisions, no alternatives, no picking, no \\npreferences. \\n\\nNot ever lying also saves you from guilt, fear, recrimination,\\nhaving to remember the lies, the risk of being punished or\\nsacked or embarrassed, ostracizing your colleagues, putting\\nyour family in jeopardy, running the risk of a criminal prose-\\ncution, and not sleeping nights.\\n\\nNever lie is really the simplest, cleanest, most honest approach\\nto your working life and career.\\n\\nIt is, of course, OK to embellish and hype up your resume or\\nexperience or enthusiasm, but please don’t actually lie. You\\nwill be found out—I guarantee it.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf I’m offering a book to a publisher and they ask me what it is\\nlike, I don’t say, “It’s alright, I suppose.” No, instead I say, “It’s\\nbrilliant, simply brilliant. It will sell extremely well and might\\nwell be the best seller we’re looking for.” Is any of this a lie?\\nNot really. I wouldn’t be writing it if I didn’t think it was bril-\\nliant. Will it sell that well? It might. Who am I to know for\\ncertain? It’s a changeable market. Is it a lie to say it will? No. \\n\\nYou are allowed to talk up your qualities or skills or expert-\\nise—just don’t actually tell a lie. And a lie is anything that can\\nbe proved definitely to be wrong. To say you are qualified as a\\nsoftware programmer when you aren’t is a lie. To say you are a\\nwizard at software programming isn’t because it is a matter of\\nopinion rather than fact. But if in doubt—never lie or embel-\\nlish if you can’t think fast on your feet.\\n\\nRULE 48\\n\\n115LO O K A F T E R Y O U R S E L F\\n\\nYOU ARE ALLOWED TO\\n\\nTALK UP YOUR QUALITIES\\n\\nOR SKILLS OR EXPERTISE—\\n\\nJUST DON’T ACTUALLY\\n\\nTELL A LIE.\\n\\n\\n\\nNever Cover up for Anyone Else\\n\\nRULE 49\\n\\n116 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nBeing a Rules Player means you are aiming for perfection, that\\nyou are setting extremely high standards for yourself. Others\\nwill not have these standards—obviously, they won’t be as suc-\\ncessful as you because of this—but they may well try to either\\nget you to lower yours or to involve you in their shenanigans.\\nWhat do you do? Again, be happy with a simple default set-\\nting—you don’t cover up for anyone, ever, under any\\ncircumstances. \\n\\nThis way it is simple. You don’t have to think about this. You\\nhave no choices or decisions to make. You know exactly where\\nyou stand. You have let your colleagues know exactly where\\nthey stand. You have let your boss know that you won’t cover\\nfor anyone; therefore you are above suspicion, trustworthy,\\nreliable, beyond reproach. \\n\\nIf you do decide to cover for others, it complicates your life so\\nmuch that it can’t really be worth it. For instance, do you only\\ncover for close colleagues or anyone who asks? Do you only\\ncover for small incidents or the big ones? What about cover-\\ning for fraud? Criminal negligence? What do you say and do\\nwhen you get found out? How do you explain it to your family\\nwhen you get sacked?\\n\\nHow do you handle it when asked to cover up for a close col-\\nleague who might well be a friend as well? You can be fairly\\nassertive and just say “No”—you don’t have to explain. Or you\\ncan soften the blow by saying: “Please don’t ask me, I would\\nhave to say no if you do,” to give them a get-out clause and\\nsave their face.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce you have done this, it gets easier—you’ve established a\\nreputation for not covering up. The hardest bit is ignoring the\\nemotional blackmail that often accompanies a request to cover\\nup for someone. But in reality that is quite easy to ignore in\\nthe sense that if people think so little of you to use this tech-\\nnique, then why the hell shouldn’t you turn them down? They\\nhave already cooked their goose by using such an approach on\\nyou.\\n\\nIf they put pressure on you, adopt the stuck record technique\\nand just keep saying: “No, I can’t, please don’t ask. No, I can’t,\\nplease don’t ask ….” They’ll crack before you. Always remem-\\nber that real friends will never ask you to cover up for them.\\n\\nRULE 49\\n\\n117LO O K A F T E R Y O U R S E L F\\n\\nIF  YOU DO DECIDE TO\\n\\nCOVER FOR OTHERS,  \\n\\nIT  COMPLICATES YOUR\\n\\nLIFE SO MUCH THAT \\n\\nIT CAN’T REALLY \\n\\nBE WORTH IT.\\n\\n\\n\\nKeep Records\\n\\nRULE 50\\n\\n118 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nWhen a publisher and I agree to do a book together, we draw\\nup a contract. This specifies all those things that could get for-\\ngotten along the way. That way, when I deliver the manuscript\\nand the publisher says, “But this is only 100 pages and I\\nthought we had agreed on 200,” I can produce the contract\\nand find the clause where it clearly states 100 pages, or so\\nmany words, or whatever.\\n\\nIf your boss asks you to do something and you make a note of\\nit—in front of him—he will have a very hard job arguing later\\nthat you’ve done it wrong or late. \\n\\nIf you have to submit a report, then drop your boss a quick\\nmemo or note outlining the salient facts, very briefly, so there\\nwill be no confusion later. Keep a copy. Make sure your boss\\nknows you have kept a copy.\\n\\nThis technique isn’t to cover your back because you are up to\\nno good. Instead it clarifies all issues. If it’s in writing, it makes\\nyour job so much simpler, so much easier. Who can argue\\nwith a written memo? In fact, such things could be forged,\\nwritten afterwards, changed, amended, and/or rewritten, but\\nwe all assume they aren’t, that they are tamper proof.\\n\\nIt is amazing how often the tiniest detail will cause a major\\nupset—unless you got it in writing in the first place. Keeping\\nrecords isn’t an anal thing to do, but a sensible precaution.\\nNone of us has perfect memory. We all forget things—dates,\\ntimes, details. Once we have made a note of whatever it is, we\\ncan refer to it later. And often surprise ourselves with how\\nbadly we have remembered something.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou will often read in management books the advice to throw\\naway all memo or emails or faxes over a certain age—if you\\nhaven’t looked at it in six months then you don’t need it.\\nRubbish. You hang on to everything. Make more filing space\\nrather than throw anything away, unless and until you are 100\\npercent certain it is not needed. I once had a major quarrel\\nwith a publisher (not this one, of course) relating to a book I\\nhad written for them five years previously. It was a dispute\\nthat wasn’t covered by anything in the contract. But I had kept\\nmy original notes and could produce them—a bit like having\\nto show your work during math at school—and could show\\nthat what they had published had been exactly what they had\\nasked for. I was off the hook. You won’t get me throwing any-\\nthing away.

You’ll have ’em eating out of your hand. Why?\\nBecause this is a rare game to play. Playing it straight is such\\nan unusual thing that they will have no defense against it, no\\nprotection. There are few management training books or\\ncourses that teach you to be nice, be straight, be honest. The\\nunspoken wisdom is generally be ruthless, take advantage,\\ndog eat dog.

If you’d sooner give up the job than\\nthe relationship, then go ahead.* Of course, with luck you\\nwon’t have to give up either.\\n\\n* With the date I mean; no need to hand your notice in before you ask your\\ncoworker out.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you get involved with a colleague, of course you have to be\\ngrown up and responsible about it. Set ground Rules for the\\npair of you to follow so that not only does the relationship not\\ninterfere with work, but also your maturity and good sense\\nwill be respected by your colleagues and managers. Here are\\nsome basic principles to get you started:\\n\\n• No public displays of affection.\\n\\n• No huddling together sharing whispered conversations\\nand in-jokes.\\n\\n• Let your immediate colleagues and managers know; oth-\\nerwise they’ll work out something’s going on and won’t\\nknow what. Then behave as if you weren’t going out\\ntogether.\\n\\n• Ask for certain tasks to be reallocated if there’s a conflict\\nof interest. (This is one reason why your boss needs to\\nknow.) For example, you can’t sensibly appraise, disci-\\npline, or interview each other.\\n\\nRULE 53\\n\\n125LO O K A F T E R Y O U R S E L F\\n\\nOF COURSE,  YOU CAN’T BE\\n\\nSURE THE RELATIONSHIP\\n\\nWILL LAST FOREVER,  BUT\\n\\nIF IT  DOESN’T HAVE A\\n\\nCHANCE, STEER CLEAR.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnderstand Others’ Motives\\n\\nRULE 54\\n\\n126 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nSo what motivates you? We know that you are a Rules\\nPlayer—honest, diligent, hard working, keen, successful, and\\nself-motivated. You get off on doing a job fabulously well,\\nimpressing your bosses, earning the respect of your colleagues\\nand the admiration, and loyalty of your juniors. You go home\\nat night knowing you’ve done a good day’s work and that\\nyou’ve been pleasant to everyone and are a thoroughly nice\\nperson. You sleep nights because you haven’t harmed anyone\\nor broken any laws or behaved badly in any way. You earn lots,\\nbut that isn’t your driving force—yours is the need to be the\\nvery best, the finest that there is. But what motivates everyone\\nelse? Ah, to really get on you will need to understand the\\nmotives of others. \\n\\nUnderstanding their motives means you have to enter the dark\\nand nebulous world of psychology. What gets others off can be\\nvery diverse:\\n\\n• Power\\n\\n• Money\\n\\n• Prestige\\n\\n• Revenge\\n\\n• A need to hurt\\n\\n• A need to be loved\\n\\n\\n\\nWhatever their motives, I can bet they aren’t Rules Players—\\nyou lot stand out a mile—aloof, calm, in control, dignified,\\nand sophisticated. Anybody whose motives are need and fear\\nand greed should be treated carefully. You will have to make\\nsure you stay on the right side of them without fawning, that\\nyou outmaneuvre them without sinking to their level and\\nwithout being paranoid. Look around your office now and\\nidentify what makes each of your colleagues tick, and do the\\nsame for your boss and their boss. Learn to identify their\\nmotives, and you will be able to handle them easily.\\nKnowledge is power.\\n\\nRULE 54\\n\\n127LO O K A F T E R Y O U R S E L F\\n\\nANYBODY WHOSE MOTIVES\\n\\nARE NEED AND FEAR AND\\n\\nGREED SHOULD BE\\n\\nTREATED CAREFULLY.\\n\\n\\n\\nAssume Everyone Else is Playing\\nby Different Rules\\n\\nRULE 55\\n\\n128 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nSo we know what Rules you are following, but what about\\nother people? What are their standards? What Rule book are\\nthey following, what drumbeat do they march to? Chances are\\nthey are making it up as they go along. This makes them\\nunpredictable and erratic. \\n\\nNot everybody will have your high standards of honesty and\\nmorality. Obviously, some people are kind and dignified—just\\nlike you—and are still able to climb the corporate ladder. But\\nthere are equally lots out there whose Rules are suspect. \\n\\nThe Rule book you now have must remain a secret. If you\\nreveal your Rules, you have broken the Rules. If you assume\\nthat everyone else is playing by different Rules, you won’t go\\nfar wrong. You don’t have to assume that their Rules are better\\nor worse than yours, merely different. If you assume that their\\nRules are the same as yours or better, you will be constantly\\nlet down, disappointed, disillusioned, saddened, and upset.\\n\\nIf you assume their Rules are worse than yours, you will grow\\nmistrustful, apprehensive, paranoid, suspicious, and sceptical.\\n\\nAssuming that their Rules are different without assuming what\\nthose Rules are keeps you open and receptive, cautious but\\nexpectant, approachable but not overly trustful, responsive\\nbut not gullible. \\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s a bit like being a martial arts exponent:\\n\\n• You are alert and prepared, but not muscle bound or\\naggressive\\n\\n• You remain flexible and fluid and can move like a cat and\\ndodge whatever is thrown your way without ever adopt-\\ning a belligerent stance\\n\\n• You are ready for anything by being grounded and \\ncentred.\\n\\nRULE 55\\n\\n129LO O K A F T E R Y O U R S E L F\\n\\nTHE RULE BOOK YOU \\n\\nNOW HAVE MUST REMAIN \\n\\nA SECRET.  \\n\\nIF  YOU REVEAL YOUR\\n\\nRULES,  YOU HAVE \\n\\nBROKEN THE RULES.\\n\\n\\n\\nKeep the Faith\\n\\nRULE 56\\n\\n130 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nThere are times when you find yourself in a job where the\\npeople around you just aren’t Rules Players in any sense. They\\nmay be corrupt or dishonest, resistant to change, or obstruc-\\ntive in the way they deal with you. What can you do?\\n\\nListen, I know this can be tough, but if you drop your stan-\\ndards, you’ll make things worse and not better. You don’t have\\nto stay in the job, of course, but I appreciate that sometimes\\nleaving a job isn’t that easy, and you may feel you have to stick\\nit out. So, keep the moral high ground and hold firm to what\\nyou believe in: decency, integrity, honesty, fair dealing,\\nchivalry, progress. If you don’t behave decently, why should\\nanyone else? It may be a slim hope for improvement, but it’s\\nall you’ve got.\\n\\nI once heard from a reader who was stuck in just such a situa-\\ntion. He was clearly a consummate Rules Player and had\\nsteadfastly refused to compromise his standards. He’d worked\\nhard to create cooperative teams and driven through changes\\nthat were unwelcome but long overdue. Some of his cowork-\\ners were so threatened by this that they accused him of all\\nkinds of corruption and bad behavior to get him sacked. And\\ndo you know what? His bosses dismissed these allegations\\noutright. You see, being a Rules Player had paid off, and\\ndespite all his problems at work, his managers weren’t stupid\\nand recognized a dedicated and loyal worker when they saw\\none.\\n\\nSo, if you’re in a similar situation, you have my sympathy. All I\\ncan say is, stick in there. If you let them get to you, or worse\\nstill corrupt you into their way of doing things, you won’t be\\n\\n\\n\\nable to survive and sleep nights. If no one is flying the flag for\\ndecency, that’s the last chance gone. Actually though, most\\npeople would rather be friendly and decent and honorable and\\ncooperative. They just don’t want to be the first to stick their\\nnecks out and do it. In a corrupt environment, it’s easier to be\\ncorrupt. But if you show the courage that others lack, many of\\nthem will follow you. Not all of them, of course, but just a few\\nallies will make you feel a whole lot happier and will vindicate\\nyour determination to do what’s right and play by the Rules no\\nmatter what.\\n\\nRULE 56\\n\\n131LO O K A F T E R Y O U R S E L F\\n\\nIF  NO ONE IS FLYING THE\\n\\nFLAG FOR DECENCY,\\n\\nTHAT’S THE \\n\\nLAST CHANCE GONE.\\n\\n\\n\\nPut Things in Perspective\\n\\nRULE 57\\n\\n132 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nWhen all is said and done, it is only a job.

This culture is\\nsometimes company led, but mostly people generated—it\\ngrows organically and without plan or strategy. If you don’t\\nknow this culture—or fail to make use of it—you can end up\\nlooking foolish and are then easy to take advantage of, or be\\nbelittled.\\n\\nBear in mind that around 70 percent of all dismissals are not\\nbecause someone couldn’t do their job properly, but because\\nthey didn’t know the corporate culture—they didn’t fit in.\\n\\nConsider this advert for a pretty big prestigious design\\nstudio—the BMD. When Bruce Mau, the owner of this com-\\npany, wanted to recruit new staff, he put out a quiz with some\\n40 questions, including, “Who made a film consisting of noth-\\ning but the color blue?”*\\n\\nBruce headed the advert, “Avoid fields. Jump fences.” As a\\nresult of this, he lured some of the best, most talented top\\ndesigners to come and work for him—or with him, as he\\ndescribes his working relationship with his staff.\\n\\nNow what sort of corporate culture do you think Bruce\\nexpects, wants, gets?

If they all\\nplay golf, then you play golf. I know you hate golf, but you\\nwill play golf—if that’s what it takes to fit in. Now you may, of\\ncourse, question whether you want to fit in. You may question\\nwhether playing golf is where you want to be. But if you are a\\nRules Player and you want to move up and be successful and\\nyou also want to be part of a particular company where play-\\ning golf is the corporate culture—then play it you must.\\n\\nRULE 58\\n\\n139B L E N D I N\\n\\nYOU DON’T HAVE TO BUY\\n\\nINTO THE CORPORATE\\n\\nCULTURE—YOU DON’T\\n\\nHAVE TO BELIEVE IN IT—\\n\\nALL YOU HAVE TO DO \\n\\nIS FIT IN.\\n\\n\\n\\nSpeak the Language\\n\\nRULE 59\\n\\n140 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nFitting in means being able to follow the corporate culture,\\nand speaking the language is a big part of this.

No, this isn’t the time or place to dis-\\ncuss whether you want to belong to a geeky company—that’s\\nfor you to do alone in the soul-searching time of the early\\nhours when you can’t sleep.\\n\\nIf the boss talks in terms of SPRs for staff product ratios, then\\nyou too must talk of SPRs. It isn’t your job to educate them,\\nre-educate them, edify them, inform them, teach them, give\\nthem a bit of class, drag them up, stop the dumbing-down\\nprocess, or instruct them. Their corporate language is what\\nyou must speak. I know there will be times when it will make\\nyou want to scream—but speak it you must. \\n\\nI once worked for an Italian boss who, because of his inade-\\nquate grasp of English, had taken to talking of “clienters,”\\nwhich was his sort of mix of clients and customers. Because he\\nwas the boss, this ridiculous term had entered the public\\ndomain, and every member of staff from the general manager\\ndown talked about the clienters. I could have stood there and\\nscreamed, “No, no, no, this is wrong, stop it at once.” Fat lot\\nof good it would have done me. It was clienters the whole\\ntime I was there, and I hated it every time I heard it. But I\\nknew the Rules and also called them clienters.\\n\\nSpend a little time listening to how your office uses language.\\nWe’re not talking accents here, but the sort of individual clien-\\nters that every office somehow manages to pick up. I also\\n\\n\\n\\nworked with a guy who talked of people working as hard as\\nMexicans. This was his way of being, what he thought, politi-\\ncally correct. It was, of course, just as bad, just as wrong, just\\nas offensive. However, he was the owner of the company, so\\nthe term “Mexicans” had stuck and, again, it was wrong and\\nhorrible, but it was in current usage.\\n\\nThe only time this Rule should be broken is where it applies\\nto swearing.

Just make sure\\nyour jeans are the smartest, the most stylish, the most fashion-\\nable, the most modern—no, no, you do not iron them! No\\ncreases, for God’s sake!\\n\\nWatch what the others do. If, at a meeting, it is jackets off and\\nsleeves rolled up, then that’s what you do. If it is very formal\\nand jackets stay on, then yours stays on as well. I know this\\nmay sound obvious, but you would be surprised how often\\nyou look around a meeting and you can see the one person\\nmarching to a different drumbeat—and that’s the one who will\\nbe ostracized by the others. \\n\\nTo a greater or lesser extent, we all need to belong to the herd,\\nto fit in, to blend in, to camouflage ourselves so we don’t draw\\nunnecessary attention to ourselves. Obviously, if it is the boss\\nwho takes their jacket off, then you too do so. Don’t become a\\nclone though and mindlessly follow what everyone else is\\ndoing. We are talking here of dressing up or down on a gen-\\neral basis, not each and every minute.\\n\\nI’ve always found it better to sit back for a moment or two to\\nsee what others do rather than to be the first to follow the\\nhead lemming. Stand back for a moment, it might be a cliff\\nand not a promotion opportunity; or a springboard with no\\nwater below.\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ve always found it useful to have a role model to check with\\nto see if they would have done a certain thing or worn a cer-\\ntain style of dress. For a lot of my business life I’ve used Cary\\nGrant. Easy then to ask, “Would Cary have worn this?” If the\\nanswer is yes, then go right ahead. If the answer is no, then\\ndon’t.

People are all different, and if you try to treat them\\nall the same you run the risk of offending them all or at least\\nfailing to satisfy any of them.\\n\\nIt is a lot easier to understand this Rule if you are a parent. If\\nyou have more than one child, you will know how essential it\\nis not to treat them the same. Each child needs different moti-\\nvating forces. For some it is enough to be mildly disappointed.\\nFor others you have to be a real ogre just to get them to get\\ndressed in the morning.\\n\\nI have five sons and a daughter, and I have to treat each one\\ndifferently. Sometimes I forget and treat them all the same, and\\nthey are quite surprised and quite hurt. Each needs me to be\\nsomething different, something unique for them, something\\nspecial. As a manager, you are a sort of parent to your people\\nand must treat them as individuals.\\n\\nI once staged a completely fake loss of temper to get my own\\nway over a fairly trivial matter. The person for whose benefit\\nthe tantrum was put on was so shocked that I was given into\\nimmediately.

But there were the odd few who didn’t respond to this\\ntype of behavior. They were so entrenched in their old-fashioned\\napproach to work that they expected a boss to be a complete\\nbastard and to shout at them and tell them what to do. And\\n\\n\\n\\nhere I was asking them how they were and what they thought\\nof it all. They couldn’t cope, and I had to be unpleasant to\\nthem to get them to respond—different strokes for different\\nfolks.\\n\\nYou have to be adaptable, ready to change quickly depending\\non what is required of you.

And\\nthat reflects well on you. So this one should be obvious. But\\nI’m amazed at how many people criticize the boss behind her\\nback, or are always ready to pass the buck on to her.\\n\\nI realize that your boss may be a fool, have no business\\nacumen, be difficult and demanding, have abysmal people\\nskills, no idea how to manage a department, and lack all\\nintegrity, talent, and diplomacy. If all that is true, her image\\ncertainly needs all the help you can give it.\\n\\nOK, few bosses are that bad. But few are faultless either, and\\nthat’s not the point. It’s just common sense. You benefit all\\nround from making your boss look good, and it’s only a matter\\nof time before your boss starts to notice.\\n\\nOf course, this makes sense when your boss is present, but if\\nyou stick up for her, give her credit and draw attention to her\\nstrengths even when she’s not there, it will do you even more\\ngood. Other senior managers will be impressed, and word will\\nget back to the boss about how you told everyone it was your\\nboss’s thoroughness that kept the exhibition stand on budget,\\nor she who negotiated that great deal, or her encouragement\\nthat gave the team the confidence to give such a good \\npresentation.\\n\\nThis is the kind of loyalty that other managers will admire and\\nwill help consolidate the rest of your department into a strong\\nteam—which will also be noticed and will rub off on every-\\none, yourself included. I’m not suggesting here that you lie\\nabout the boss if she in fact makes a complete mess of things.\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m suggesting that you keep quiet on the subject if she really\\nscrewed up, and make a noise about the stuff she gets right.\\n\\nOf course, there will be times when you and your colleagues\\nneed to discuss the boss honestly to work as a team, but make\\nsure you make only those negative points that are strictly nec-\\nessary, and be fair and impersonal about them. It’s probably\\nwise to acknowledge that your boss is likely to give you the\\ninformation you need at the last possible minute, but you can\\nstill voice it in a matter-of-fact practical way rather than a\\nbitchy, critical way.\\n\\nRULE 62\\n\\n147B L E N D I N\\n\\nTHIS IS THE KIND OF\\n\\nLOYALTY THAT OTHER\\n\\nMANAGERS WILL ADMIRE.\\n\\n\\n\\nKnow Where to Hang Out, \\nand When\\n\\nRULE 63\\n\\n148 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nThere are always key places where the high and mighty gather\\nat formal and informal times.

It is your duty to know where this\\nis. Now don’t go rushing in there and make a complete idiot of\\nyourself. You have to spy out the land, learn the territory so as\\nto be informed of everything you need to know before going\\nin. Does the restaurant have a dress code or style you should\\nknow about? Is there a waiting list for membership of the golf\\nclub? Is the bar the sort of place you’d go alone, or should you\\ngo with your partner? Is the club easy to join?

They might be quite\\nsimple:\\n\\n• You never take partners to the staff dinner.\\n\\n• You always turn up for the staff meetings on your days\\noff.\\n\\n• You never park in a certain couple of spaces even though\\nthey aren’t marked because they are unofficially reserved\\nfor the CEO’s partner and kids.\\n\\n• You always give a $5 to the leaving envelopes that go\\nround but only a couple of dollars for the birthdays.\\n\\n• You never take the jelly doughnut with the coffee because\\nthat’s Sylvia’s—always has been, always will be.\\n\\n• You always refer to the CEO as Charles to his face but as\\nCharlie to the rest of the staff.\\n\\n• It is OK to order wine with lunch, but beer really is\\nfrowned on.\\n\\nYou may never know where some of these unwritten Rules\\ncome from—Charles once got hit by a beer drinking\\nemployee, hence no beer at lunch; Charles was once embar-\\nrassed by the wife of a junior manager who made a not\\ncompletely unsuccessful pass at him at a staff dinner, hence no\\npartners.\\n\\nOf course, these social protocols may be obvious—Sylvia likes\\nthe jelly doughnuts and she has the clout to get her own\\nway—the important thing is to identify them, file them away if\\n\\n\\n\\nyou like, but by golly you’d better know them if you don’t\\nwant to make any terrible social gaffes.\\n\\nI once worked for a company where it was considered taboo to\\ndrink during a working day in any way. You couldn’t even\\nhave a beer at lunch. Alcohol was a big no-no and I couldn’t\\nfind out why. I was happy to go along with this, as I am not a\\ndrinker, but it puzzled me. I eventually found out that the\\ncompany had had a finance manager who had spent every\\nafternoon having 40 winks in his office—sleeping it off. In\\nfact, he wasn’t. He did drink a lot every lunchtime, but the\\nafternoons were spent carefully siphoning off funds to his own\\naccounts. He was eventually caught and dismissed, but after\\nthat no drinking was the Rule—and no closed office doors.\\n\\nRULE 64\\n\\n151B L E N D I N\\n\\nOF COURSE,  THESE \\n\\nSOCIAL PROTOCOLS MAY\\n\\nBE OBVIOUS—THE\\n\\nIMPORTANT THING IS \\n\\nTO IDENTIFY THEM, \\n\\nFILE THEM AWAY.\\n\\n\\n\\nKnow the Rules About Authority\\n\\nRULE 65\\n\\n152 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nWho runs your office? I bet it ain’t the boss. Bosses tend to\\ncloset themselves away in their ivory office, leaving the real\\njob of running the business to someone else. Your job is to\\nidentify this person and stay on the right side of them.\\n\\nI have worked for companies where the real power resided in\\nthe hands of a PR consultant, a legal secretary, an auditor, a\\ncustomer, and a junior manager. In each and every case, the\\nreason why they were really in charge was that they\\n\\n• Had the ear of the boss\\n\\n• Were trusted by the boss\\n\\n• Carried out a subtle whispering campaign rather than\\nsaying anything outright or up front\\n\\n• Had been there quite some time\\n\\n• Were motivated entirely by power and control\\n\\n• Were invariably unpleasant enough to use various tactics\\nto get their own way—no matter what\\n\\n• Were extremely clever, but lacking the experience, qualifi-\\ncations, or skill to actually do the job properly\\n\\nIn each case, once I had made a friend of these people I got on\\nbetter. To begin with, I didn’t spot them immediately. This\\nalways caused me problems. I would go to the boss and only\\nlater be made to realize I had committed a gaffe by doing so—\\n“Oh everything goes through Sarah first,” “I’ll just run it by\\nJanine first to see if she thinks it a good idea,” “Do you want\\nto check this out with Trevor and come back to me?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI soon learned to go to the person who had the ear of the boss\\nfirst. Play the game with this person, and don’t make an\\nenemy of her. She is the real authority, and you should pay her\\nhomage. I know it ain’t fair and you hate it, but until a better\\nsystem comes along, we have to work with what we’ve got.\\n\\nRULE 65\\n\\n153B L E N D I N\\n\\nWHO RUNS YOUR OFFICE? \\n\\nI  BET IT  AIN’T THE BOSS.\\n\\n\\n\\nKnow the Rules About the Office\\nHierarchy\\n\\nRULE 66\\n\\n154 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nThis Rule goes hand in hand with the previous one. You have\\nto know who has the boss’s ear, and you have to know who\\nruns the office. You might be quite senior, but you won’t get\\nthe key to the stationery cupboard no matter what, not unless\\nyou speak nicely to Mark first. And your morning coffee is\\ngoing to be delivered cold if you upset the catering staff at all\\nby wandering up to the break room and ordering your coffee\\nwithout going through the office manager first.\\n\\nOffice protocols and hierarchies are old fashioned, petty, small\\nminded, outdated, and yet still very much with us. It wasn’t\\nthat long ago that I worked in an office where you had to take\\nyour typing to an office manager who then handed it to a\\ntypist and it was returned to you later, all done. \\n\\nTrouble was that if you upset the office manager—and you\\ncould do this by smoking near her, talking about the boss in a\\nderogatory way, swearing, coming to work causally dressed—\\nyou got your work given to the worst typist and it came back\\nlate, full of mistakes, coffee cup stained, misspelled, no copies,\\nyou name it. \\n\\nOnce you got on the right side of the office manager, it all\\nchanged and your typist presented you with exemplary work,\\non time and immaculate.\\n\\nNow, you might say that this was the way it was and I couldn’t\\nreally complain. Yes, but the office manager wasn’t my office\\nmanager. I only used the typing facility occasionally and I was\\nsenior. I still had to go through this hierarchy, which involved\\nme in having to seek the patronage of someone junior to get a\\nfairly mundane and routine job done. It sure made me mad,\\n\\n\\n\\nand I had to spend quite a lot of time wooing the office man-\\nager just to get a letter done. It was time consuming,\\nunproductive, and petty. But you’re right—we have to work\\nwith what we’ve got.\\n\\nSo what do we do? We play the game. We have no choice but\\nto smile and woo them.\\n\\nRULE 66\\n\\n155B L E N D I N\\n\\nOFFICE PROTOCOLS AND\\n\\nHIERARCHIES ARE OLD\\n\\nFASHIONED, PETTY,  \\n\\nSMALL MINDED,\\n\\nOUTDATED, AND YET STILL\\n\\nVERY MUCH WITH US.\\n\\n\\n\\nNever Disapprove of Others\\n\\nRULE 67\\n\\n156 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nSo, they’re all going to the wine bar again this lunchtime. You\\nhate that. You hate the noise, the smell, the inane chatter\\nabout last night’s TV programs. \\n\\nBut do you tell them this? No, you do not. You need to be one\\nof the crowd—blend in. You need them to think you’re there,\\nin spirit if not in body, without actually being there. Easy. You\\nget out of it by saying you have to do some shopping, visit a\\nfriend, go to the gym.\\n\\nDon’t disapprove of the way they spend their lunch break—\\nthis will make them think of you as an outsider. Nor do you\\ntell them you’re staying in the office to catch up on some\\nwork—they will think you a creep. But it is fine to say you are\\ngoing to do some shopping and then find somewhere nice to\\npark in your car with a soft drink and a decent sandwich—and\\nyour laptop. You can get all that extra work done, but you\\ndon’t have to let them know.\\n\\nDon’t tell them that you think drinking at lunchtime is\\nunhealthy and unproductive—tell them you’ll be along in a bit\\nand to carry on without you—“get one in for me.” This way\\nthe lunchtime crowd will accept you as “one of them” without\\nyour ever having to be one. You will be accepted if you don’t \\ndisapprove.\\n\\nOr perhaps they all go bowling together on a Tuesday evening.\\nNo, you don’t say “but bowling is for geeks, isn’t it?” Instead\\nyou can say, “Ah, Tuesday evenings? That’s my night for taking\\nmy mother to the cinema, I’m afraid.” Or how about you swal-\\nlow your pride, your standards, and your disapproval—and\\nactually go. Who knows, maybe you’ll have fun. But you will\\n\\n\\n\\nblend in and you won’t show that you disapprove of your col-\\nleagues.

Smart movers concentrate on\\ntheir own path and ignore the route others choose to take.\\nKeep focused on where you are going, and ignore anything\\nothers are up to. By ignoring, it is easier to stop making judg-\\nments. If you make judgments, you categorize yourself and\\nthus make it much more difficult to be flexible and to move\\neasily from situation to situation.

If you threaten\\nthem—or, and this is important, are thought to threaten\\nthem—they won’t like it. So don’t. Understand that this herd\\nmentality is important and that to blend in is important.\\n\\nSuppose your herd is a pride of lions. Yes, you can roll in the\\ndust, roar, eat zebras, and be very fierce and you will blend\\nin—you will be a lion. This doesn’t mean you have to capitu-\\nlate though or be weak. In every pride there is a top dog—a\\nsenior lion. You can blend in but still stand out by being in\\ncharge, being a pack leader, being the head honcho.\\n\\nBlending in is about being a chameleon, not a wimp. Just\\nbecause I say you ought to blend in doesn’t mean you have to\\ngive up your identity or become a clone or lose all sense of\\nyour individuality. All you have to do is know and understand\\nherd mentality—and then use it to your own advantage. I once\\nsaw an employee reduced to tears because he didn’t know the\\nsystem and the herd—his fellow workers—turned on him. He\\nwas “different,” and they smelled his fear and went for him. \\n\\nWhat you are going to be is the proverbial wolf in sheep’s\\nclothing.

I assume it is her job you want. If it\\nain’t, whose job is it? Or have I been wasting my time here?\\nCome on, whose job do you want? Let’s start with the boss.\\nHow does your boss talk?\\n\\nWhat do I mean—how does your boss talk? I’ll explain. It isn’t\\nher accent or pronunciation—how she sounds—but the con-\\ntent, what she says. I bet you talk in terms of “I,” whereas\\nyour boss will probably use “we” much more. You might speak\\nfrom a worker’s point of view, whereas your boss will speak on\\nbehalf of the company.\\n\\nThe more senior you go, the less likely you are to\\n\\n• Chatter inanely\\n\\n• Gossip\\n\\n• Swear\\n\\n• Talk about last night’s TV programs or any other issues\\nthat have no relevance to the work being done—bosses\\ntend to be much more focused and less inclined to waste\\ntime\\n\\n• Prattle on—bosses tend to be more thoughtful and pause\\nbefore speaking (or at least the good ones do)\\n\\nSo, if you are going to talk one step up, you need to be more\\nthoughtful, talk about issues that are relevant, talk in terms of\\n“we” rather than “I,” be focused and dynamic, and keep per-\\nsonal details to yourself—bosses don’t chatter or gossip about\\ntheir social lives.\\n\\n\\n\\nI guess what you have to do is be the grown-up and speak \\nto the other workers as children. You become aloof and\\nslightly withdrawn, mature and responsible, dependable and\\nconscientious.\\n\\nWhen I say aloof I do not mean arrogant. I’m sure you have\\nencountered lots of managers who make this simple mistake.\\nArrogance has no place at work. Arrogance is conceit and fake\\nimportance. Aloofness is being slightly withdrawn, being\\ndetached, being superior by nature of experience, skill, and\\nnatural ability.\\n\\nRULE 70\\n\\n167H AV E A P L A N\\n\\nBE FOCUSED AND\\n\\nDYNAMIC,  AND KEEP\\n\\nPERSONAL DETAILS TO\\n\\nYOURSELF—BOSSES \\n\\nDON’T CHATTER OR \\n\\nGOSSIP ABOUT THEIR\\n\\nSOCIAL LIVES.\\n\\n\\n\\nAct One Step Ahead\\n\\nRULE 71\\n\\n168 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nSo, we’ve got you dressing one step up and talking one step\\nup; now you have to act one step up. I know, I know, it’s all\\ntoo much, too hard, too difficult. Who said this was going to\\nbe easy? Not me, pal. I told you right from the word go that\\nthis was going to be hard—harder in fact than just doing the\\njob like normal people. Being a Rules Player takes more effort,\\nrequires more attention to detail, and is generally more like\\nhard work than hard work. But the results are fantastic. In\\nfact, being a Rules Player automatically qualifies you for pro-\\nmotion—if you can be a Rules Player you deserve to be\\npromoted. It’s a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. Carrying out\\nthe Rules requires strength of character, will power, determi-\\nnation, honesty, courage, experience, great talent, dedication,\\ndrive, nerve, and charisma—if you’ve got all these, you’ll be\\npromoted anyway.\\n\\nSo, act one step up. Look at the way your boss enters the\\noffice. Notice anything? Watch the way he answers the phone,\\ntalks to staff, entertains customers, holds his pen, hangs up his\\ncoat, opens his office door, sits down, stands up—anything he\\ndoes. I bet you’ll notice that he moves differently from, say, the\\noffice manager or the maintenance team or the sales force or\\nthe marketing folk or the PR people.\\n\\nActing one step up requires you to\\n\\n• Be more certain of yourself\\n\\n• Be more mature\\n\\n• Be more confident\\n\\n\\n\\nYou have to be languid and suave and sophisticated—no, no,\\nnot swaggering or aggressive. A simple exercise—do you have\\nyour own office? Do people knock on your door? What do\\nyou say? A mild “Come in, please”? or a one-step-up “Come.”\\nThe higher you go, the less time you have to waste. You get\\nslicker and quicker, sleeker and fitter. You don’t have time to\\nwaffle or use long expressions—a simple “Come” is more\\nexpedient. You too have to be expedient.

Yes, of course they can. \\nRead on.\\n\\nRULE 72\\n\\n171H AV E A P L A N\\n\\nYOU WILL START TO THINK\\n\\nLIKE A BOSS AND LESS\\n\\nLIKE A WORKER.\\n\\n\\n\\nAddress Corporate Issues and\\nProblems\\n\\nRULE 73\\n\\n172 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nWe talked about looking at things from the company’s point of\\nview and not from your own. You have to take this further and\\ntalk only about corporate issues and problems even when you\\nare talking to yourself or close colleagues. You have to con-\\nvince them you are already a boss—see Rule 78.\\n\\nI remember doing my first book and naturally being terribly\\nconcerned with the look of it—did the cover look right, feel\\nright, smell right? The marketing manager, obviously getting\\nfed up with the interminable dreary phone calls from me to\\ncheck up on every little detail, finally said, “Tins of beans,\\ndear boy, tins of beans.” I didn’t know what he meant, and he\\nhad to explain it all in words of one syllable. Each book is a\\nproduct—a tin of beans—it sits on a shelf and gets bought or\\nnot bought depending on factors over which I, the mere little\\nwriter, have no control—such as the position of the book on\\nthe shelves, the competition stationed nearby, the weather, any\\ndiscounts the bookstore happens to be offering, and on and on\\nand on. All of these things, including fascinating things, such\\nas the color of the cover, can affect sales. It was my job to\\nsupply the text and then to start thinking about the corporate\\nissues, such as how many tins of beans get sold in any\\naccounting period, what my percentage share of any tin of\\nbeans is, what the next tin of beans will be, and can we sell\\nthem spaghetti next time?\\n\\nWhen problems crop up, it is easy to see things from your\\nown point of view—how it directly affects you. Once you\\nmake the leap to corporate speak, it gets easier to stop doing\\nthis and to start seeing problems from the company’s point of\\n\\n\\n\\nview. This doesn’t mean you have to become a company\\nperson hook, line and sinker. In fact, you are allowed to be\\nhonest and express your opinion. If it stinks it stinks—and\\nyou should say so. But say so from the company’s point of\\nview and not your own.\\n\\nIf the company suggests a new procedure, immediately think\\nhow it affects your customers and not you.\\n\\nRULE 73\\n\\n173H AV E A P L A N\\n\\nIF  THE COMPANY\\n\\nSUGGESTS A NEW\\n\\nPROCEDURE, IMMEDIATELY\\n\\nTHINK HOW IT AFFECTS\\n\\nYOUR CUSTOMERS AND\\n\\nNOT YOU.\\n\\n\\n\\nMake Your Company Better for\\nHaving You There\\n\\nRULE 74\\n\\n174 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nOne of the most satisfying ways to make your name in an\\norganization is to propose a change that will benefit everyone,\\nnot just your own job or even your department.\\n\\nI’ll give you an example. I worked in a company that had one\\nof those suggestion boxes that most people thought was a bit\\nof a pointless exercise, and we didn’t believe anyone would\\ntake any notice of the suggestions anyway. Until this woman\\nwe hardly knew made a blindingly simple suggestion via the\\nbox. She recommended that all letters should be sent by\\nsecond class post as standard, unless there was a good reason\\nto upgrade it to first class. Up until then all post had gone first\\nclass.\\n\\nThis was exactly the sort of thing I’m talking about, for several\\nreasons:\\n\\n• It was incredibly straightforward and required no com-\\nplex explanations.\\n\\n• It could be put into practice by everyone in the organiza-\\ntion at no cost.\\n\\n• It was easy to implement.\\n\\n• It saved the company a lot of money.\\n\\nThat’s what you’re looking for, ideally. Simple, universal, and of\\nclear and immediate benefit. You can imagine how envious the\\nrest of us were when this previously insignificant employee \\nwas the focus of managerial praise and recognition. And\\ndeservedly so.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo take a good look at your own job, and see if you can find\\nanything that will benefit everyone—maybe you can see a way\\nto do something cheaper, quicker, or better. Or perhaps you\\nhave (or can cultivate) a resource that everyone can use. This\\nis an extension of Rule 4 actually, but this time you’re finding\\nsomething that benefits your colleagues too. Such as collecting\\nlots of disparate information into one place so people can\\naccess it more easily. Or writing up a proper user manual for\\nthe phone system that every department can use to train new\\nstaff.\\n\\nI’m sure you’re getting the message: that if you look for ways\\nto create assets for everyone to share, the credit will rub off on\\nyou every time they’re used. And that’s what it’s all about.\\nGenuinely helping everyone, and yourself most of all.\\n\\nRULE 74\\n\\n175H AV E A P L A N\\n\\nCAN YOU SEE A WAY TO DO\\n\\nSOMETHING CHEAPER,\\n\\nQUICKER,  OR BETTER?\\n\\n\\n\\nTalk of “We” Rather Than “I”\\n\\nRULE 75\\n\\n176 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nI once worked for a boss who asked who we worked for.

That is the bottom line. If you\\ncan’t do the job, leave the stage. \\n\\nThese Rules are not for the bullshitters or the posers.

Watch what she does\\nsuperbly well and start practicing her smart moves now.\\n\\nIf you are going to walk your walk, you have to have the right\\nmannerisms, the right dress code, the right way of speaking,\\n\\n\\n\\nthe right way of acting, the right responses, and the right atti-\\ntude.

Draw attention to yourself, and you\\nwill be spotted as an interloper, a spy, an intruder, a gate-\\ncrasher. Remember as a small child you could attend\\ngrown-up parties if you stayed quiet. They forgot you were\\nthere. Once spotted, you got carried off to bed—where you\\nbelonged. It’s the same as a junior. You can hang around and\\nlearn, but don’t blow it or you’ll be sent back to bed metaphor-\\nically.\\n\\nWhen I was an office junior I noticed that senior members of\\nstaff tended to hang back after meetings sort of chewing the\\nfat among themselves. The juniors scuttled off leaving these\\nbigwigs to chat. I found that if I hung around also, sort of tidy-\\ning up the table, emptying ashtrays (those were the days) and\\nkeeping quiet, then I got to overhear a lot and was even con-\\nsulted on the odd occasion—“Ah, Richard, you’re part of the\\nnew invoicing procedures, what do you think of them?” This\\nwas my chance to shine. I blew it, of course, and stammered\\nand blushed and was tongue tied and useless. Next time I got\\nit better and eventually got it right.\\n\\nThere came a time when I was asked something and I was\\ncoherent, confident and mature.

I was allowed to\\nbypass this system, and I put it all down to hanging around\\nthe top guns.\\n\\n\\n\\nSometimes you will notice a boss sitting on his own at a lunch\\nor social occasion. Most “workers” are too nervous to go up to\\nbosses and chat or so entrenched in their social class thing\\nthat they can’t talk to them. Forget that. Go up and make\\nsmall talk. You’ll be amazed how often bosses are grateful for a\\n“worker” talking to them because they too are human and feel\\nisolated, lonely, ignored, forgotten. They are glad for a chat,\\njust so long as you don’t take advantage and ask about a pay\\nrise or time off or your vacation. But it is OK to ask about\\ntheir experiences—“So how did you get into marketing, Ms.\\nJohnson?”\\n\\nYou may well find you pick up useful hints and tips as well as\\ngetting ready for the next Rule—getting people to assume you\\nhave already made the step.\\n\\nRULE 77\\n\\n181H AV E A P L A N\\n\\nYOU’LL BE AMAZED \\n\\nHOW OFTEN BOSSES \\n\\nARE GRATEFUL FOR \\n\\nA “WORKER” TALKING \\n\\nTO THEM.\\n\\n\\n\\nGet People to Assume You Have\\nAlready Made the Step\\n\\nRULE 78\\n\\n182 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nAct like a general manager, and people will accept you as one.\\nAct like an office junior, and that’s what people will think you\\nare.

If you come to work wearing tennis shoes\\nand sweats, you won’t command the same respect as you\\nwould if you wore a smart business suit and looked the\\npart.\\n\\n• Speak of “we.” Don’t talk of “I” and refer every problem\\nback to how it affects you—“I can’t work through my\\nlunch break, I’m entitled to my hour off”—instead of\\n“We” and seeing things from the company’s point of view,\\nwhat’s best for the whole organization—“We need to pull\\ntogether here. I’m happy to work through the lunch break\\nto help us get this problem solved.”\\n\\n• Talk about the business. If you talk about what you\\nwatched on TV last night and where you are going on\\nvacation and what you are going to do over the weekend,\\nyou come across as more lightweight—and thus junior—\\nthan if you talk about company issues, what your\\ndepartment’s plans are for the future, how the rise in\\ninterest rates is going to affect business over the next few\\nmonths, and what you are going to do about exchange\\nrates and the euro.\\n\\n\\n\\nBasically, what you have to do is get people to recognize you\\nas a heavyweight and not a lightweight. Be serious, mature,\\ngrown-up, and adult. This doesn’t mean you have to be a geek,\\na nerd, a goody-goody, or a bore. You can still take a joke,\\nenjoy a laugh, smile, be lighthearted and jovial, be fun and full\\nof beans. You need to project a mature but fun image.

So, you’ve got your eye on the next step, the\\nnext job. Fine, good. But what about after that? What’s your\\nnext step? What’s your next target? \\n\\nEven before you’ve got your next promotion, you should\\nalready be practicing for the next step. Because if you aren’t\\ngetting ready now, when will you be? There is always an\\nopportunity to miss a step out, to skip over a promotion if you\\nplay this game well. I’m not suggesting this should always be\\nyour aim, but be prepared just in case it happens.\\n\\nOf course, you have your long- and short-term plans—so you\\nwill have plotted your career path and know the steps you\\nhave to take on your great journey. Even now you will be get-\\nting people to assume you have already made the next step,\\nacting the part of the next step, walking your walk, and talk-\\ning as if you were already the boss, but it doesn’t hurt to start\\npracticing for the step after that. \\n\\nLetting people see that you are officer material is no bad thing.\\nOnce people get in the habit of assuming you are a high flier,\\nyou become one. If you dress down, talk trivia, don’t pull your\\nweight, and act like you are a drudge or a drone, you will get\\naccepted as that—and stay right where you are. \\n\\n\\n\\nLook around the office. Can you spot the drudges and the\\ndrones? The worker ants? The plodders and the sloggers? \\nNow look again and spot the high fliers, the heavyweights, the\\ngo-getters, the live wires. Can you see the difference? Can you\\nsee what you have to do? Can you see how acting the part\\nmakes you that part? Can you? Can you?\\n\\nWhatever step you are preparing for, make sure that every-\\nthing you do is genuine, real, and worthwhile. I once worked\\nwith a young man who was a high flier. He was preparing for\\nhis next step. He took to coming to work carrying a briefcase\\nwhen none of his colleagues did—none of us needed one.\\nTrouble is Ray’s briefcase fell open one day and revealed to the\\nentire world that all it contained was his sandwiches, a news-\\npaper and a set of keys. It was humiliating for him,\\nembarrassing for us, and sad for everyone.

No one likes a\\nsmart ass and you might be seen as one if you cut loose from\\nthe herd and start looking good and looking cool. They may\\nhave a go. They may like to have a pop at you. How do you\\ndiffuse their anger?\\n\\nFirst you have to understand that there are two types of anger:\\n\\n• Justified anger \\n\\n• Tactical anger.\\n\\nJustified anger is exactly that—justified. You just ran over a\\nguy’s foot in your car because you weren’t looking. He is quite\\njustifiably pissed off. What do you do? You get out of the car\\nand apologize. Say, and mean, that you are sorry. Don’t deny it\\nwas your fault. Don’t tell him it is nothing and he is making a\\nbit of a fuss and you once had your entire leg ripped off and\\nnever even noticed. Don’t try and explain why you weren’t\\nlooking where you were going. Don’t try to brush off the\\nwhole thing—“I’d have thought you’d have been pleased to\\nhave had your foot run over by a top of the range Aston\\nMartin.” And for God’s sake don’t laugh. \\n\\nJustifiable anger needs a result. If you have done something\\nwrong, listen to the guy—he is angry. You have made him so.\\nListen to what you have done wrong. And then apologize and\\nfind some way to put things right. Show the person that you \\nsympathize—you may not be able to give him what he wants\\nbut you can still let him know that you appreciate his feelings.\\nDon’t brush his feelings aside—they are justified.\\n\\n\\n\\nTactical anger is, however, another thing entirely. Tactical\\nanger is used to make you do things you don’t want to. People\\nlose their temper to intimidate you. The worst thing you can\\ndo is let them get away with it. If you do, they’ll keep doing it,\\nto you and to others. You must stop them at once. The way to\\ndo this is simply to say, “I don’t like being shouted at/threat-\\nened/intimidated/bullied/whatever, and I shall leave if you\\ndon’t stop/calm down/put your fists down/let go of my throat,”\\nwhatever.\\n\\nIf they continue, then just leave. That’s it. Say nothing; just\\nwalk out of the room. Do this often enough and they will get\\nthe message.\\n\\nRULE 86\\n\\n203C U LT I VAT E D I P LO M A C Y\\n\\nFOR GOD’S SAKE DON’T\\n\\nLAUGH.\\n\\n\\n\\nStand Your Ground\\n\\nRULE 87\\n\\n204 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nNo one is allowed to bully you, threaten you, shout at you, hit\\nyou, intimidate you, frighten you, tease you, victimize you, or\\ntorment you in any way. You are an employee. If you aren’t\\ndoing your job properly, you should be taken to one side and\\nhave your mistakes pointed out calmly and rationally.\\nAnything else is abuse. \\n\\nYou are allowed to refuse abuse. You are allowed, calmly and\\nrationally, to tell someone to stop at once or you are entitled to\\nuse the full weight of the law to get someone to stop. You have\\nto know when to stand your ground.\\n\\nObviously, if someone is mildly teasing—the same as everyone\\nelse gets—then you can’t walk out and claim unfair dismissal.\\nIf your boss snaps at you occasionally—the same as they do to\\nall employees—you can’t demand the Court of Human Rights\\nhas them strung up, even if they are out of order. If a colleague\\nsays she’ll give you a slap if you take her hole puncher again,\\nyou can’t really expect the Supreme Court to take up your\\ncase. We are talking real abuse here, not the sort of rough and\\ntumble you’d expect in the tumult of a busy working life.\\n\\nStanding your ground is about having standards, drawing a\\nline in the sand, and saying, “I will put up with this, but not\\nthis,” or “I will allow them to do this to me, but not this.”\\n\\nOne approach is to ask the person open questions. This avoids\\ntrying to be underhand and playing the same game she is, and\\nif you do it in front of other people, it can put the person on\\nthe spot and make her feel very uncomfortable and she’ll learn\\nto think twice about putting you in that situation again. So, at\\n\\n\\n\\na meeting you can ask politely, “Why did you not tell me\\nabout this at last week’s meeting? It would clearly have been\\nuseful information for me to have.” Then keep quiet so the\\nonus is on her to justify herself. Or say, “I feel put down when\\nyou make rude remarks. Why do you do it?” That should put\\na stop to their nasty ways.\\n\\nStanding your ground is about having standards, drawing a\\nline in the sand, and saying, “I will put up with this, but not\\nthis.”\\n\\nStanding your ground is about being assertive. Being assertive\\nis about stating your bottom line: “I don’t appreciate being\\nlocked in dark cupboards and I shall have to report this inci-\\ndent to my union representative/boss/the police/the health and\\nsafety committee/my mother.”\\n\\nIf bullied, stick to the stuck record—“I don’t appreciate being\\ntreated like this. I don’t appreciate being treated like this.

I was quite junior and\\nhad few choices—walk away from the job or go over his head\\nand report him. But his boss was also his best friend. If I\\nreported him, I would have been out on my ear pretty quick. I\\nneeded the job and didn’t want to walk away. I had to be quite\\ndevious, but I basically got him to treat me badly—ridiculing,\\nabusive language, that sort of thing—when one of our major\\ncustomers was listening. \\n\\nMy boss didn’t know this, and the customer was furious. He\\nsorted my boss out in no uncertain terms. Said he ought to be\\n\\n\\n\\nashamed of himself treating a junior like that.

OK, so you know these rules; what\\nuse are they to you? Easy. It’s a bit like the unions used to be—\\nworking to an obscure rule book that the management never\\nreally understood or knew. You will be able to outmaneuvre\\nanyone by knowing these unwritten Rules.\\n\\nI went to work in an office where the most junior had to take\\nthe most senior boss his coffee in the mornings and the\\nunwritten rule was that this junior would wait while he drank\\nthe coffee. The junior didn’t “have” to, it was just expected of\\nhim. I was that junior. For about five minutes every day I had\\nthe ultimate boss’s undivided attention. I had the ear of the\\n\\nKnow All the Unspoken Rules \\nof Office Life\\n\\n\\n\\nhighest. I had access to God. I milked it, as you might have\\nguessed.\\n\\nI got my department head moved to another department. He\\nwas unpopular and I merely mentioned to the big boss that\\nthe department head had certain skills that he hadn’t revealed,\\nbut that would come in very useful in the new department. He \\nwas moved.\\n\\nYOU WILL BE ABLE TO\\n\\nOUTMANEUVRE ANYONE BY\\n\\nKNOWING THESE\\n\\nUNWRITTEN RULES.\\n\\nRULE 89\\n\\n213K N O W T H E SY S T E M—A N D M I L K I T\\n\\n\\n\\nKnow What to Call Everyone\\n\\nRULE 90\\n\\n214 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nYes, you should know what to call everyone, but that doesn’t\\nmean you are going to call them that. I dare say Mr. Cutler has\\nlong since forgotten me. I was his assistant many years ago.\\nWhen he changed companies he phoned me and asked me to\\njoin the new firm with him—more money, etc.—so I said yes. \\n\\nOn my first day working with him at the new company, he\\nsaid to me, “Call me Mr. Cutler.” No way, Peter. I had called\\nhim Peter at the old place and was going to carry on calling\\nhim that. But not quite yet. There were several assistants, and\\nthey needed to get to know this new boss, this Mr. Cutler.\\nThat’s what they called him, because that’s what he wanted. I\\nwaited until the moment was right and we were all gathered\\ntogether. Then I addressed him as Peter. \\n\\nHe couldn’t pull me up short in front of my peers and they\\nthought, quite rightly, that I had secret access to him that they\\ndidn’t. For me the Mr. Cutler nonsense was never mentioned\\nagain and I was the “senior” assistant because I called him\\nPeter. What’s in a name? A whole lot.\\n\\nYou need to know that Mrs. Robertson in accounts is always\\naddressed as Mrs. Robertson and never as Mary, although you\\nknow that is her name and you are senior to her. Why not call\\nher Mary? Because she doesn’t like it and she handles the pay-\\nchecks. They have been known to go astray, be very late, be\\nmade out for much less than the anticipated amount—and all\\nto people who inadvertently called her Mary.\\n\\nIn one job, I worked with an administrative manager who was\\nknown, for curious reasons, as Buckethead. It’s a long story,\\nand you really don’t want to know. (No, believe me, you really\\n\\n\\n\\ndon’t.) He was addressed to his face as Buckethead by all the\\nsenior staff—including me as finance manager. He was\\nBuckethead to the board. He was Buckethead to most of the\\nsecretarial staff. But anyone else and he was Mr. Taylor, never\\nBuckethead. I have seen him savage a young junior who made\\nthe mistake and called him Buckethead. Now why this strange\\ndivision between who could and who could not call him that\\nname? I have no idea but I did have a very strange relationship\\nwith him. Technically, he was my senior, albeit if only slightly.\\nBut I was power hungry in those days, and I wanted to control\\neverything. I never ever called him Buckethead. I didn’t like\\nhim. To me he was always Mr. Taylor. Why? Because it sepa-\\nrated us and made me different from the other senior\\nmanagers. I stood alone and Buckethead could never get close\\nto me, never be a “friend.” I played the aloof game and was\\neventually offered the general managership of the company,\\nwhich would have made him my junior. Success? Yes, but it\\nfelt a hollow victory—I wasn’t playing the Rules as effectively\\nthen as now—and I left for new challenges, new horizons.\\n\\nRULE 90\\n\\n215K N O W T H E SY S T E M—A N D M I L K I T\\n\\n“CALL ME MR.

Clones stay\\nlate. Drones stay late. Worker ants stay late. Rules Players go\\nhome when they want to—and that is invariably earlier than\\nanyone else.\\n\\nIt’s the same with arriving in the office in the morning. Who\\nsays you have to arrive early? No one. It is one of those\\nunwritten rules we need to know, so we can adapt it to our\\nown ends.\\n\\nThe object of the exercise is to be thought to be working as\\nhard as everyone else. The game is to get away with being\\nthought of as a conformist, a drone, when in fact you don’t\\nhave to because you are so much better than that. You get your\\nwork done in record time so you don’t have to stay late.\\n\\nIf you ever watch motivational speakers, they always put their\\nhand up when they ask you—and the rest of the audience—a\\nquestion. This sets the lead, and you automatically put your\\nhand up because there is already one hand up in the room.\\nSilly, isn’t it? But it only takes one of you to leave at a reason-\\nable time for everyone else to follow suit. Staying because you\\nthink everyone else is staying is called “presenteeism” and is a\\ncurse of modern office life. We all think that everyone else is\\nwatching us, as we are watching them, to see who will be the\\nfirst to break, to leave, to incur the boss’s wrath.\\n\\nIt is, however, a myth. The first to leave isn’t going to be miss-\\ning anything. That person will be liberating the rest of us.\\nLeave now and set us free, please.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fear of missing something is very real. But if we are lead-\\ning exciting and interesting lives, we know that we are the\\ncenter of the universe and that the others who stay behind are\\nthe ones who are in reality missing out, missing something,\\nmissing in action.\\n\\nPeople think that leaving early—or at the right time actually,\\nthe time we are contracted to leave—will draw undue atten-\\ntion to us, make us seem to be shirkers. But if we leave\\nconfidently and honestly, this doesn’t happen. We only get\\nviewed badly for leaving before others if we slink out, leave by\\nthe back door, creep away into the night with our tail between\\nour legs. So wave boldly and tell them, “Last one to leave\\nturns out the lights.” Whether it is fair to point out that if they\\nwere any good at their jobs they too, like you, would have fin-\\nished their work on time is debatable. You are allowed to\\nthink it though.\\n\\nRULE 91\\n\\n217K N O W T H E SY S T E M—A N D M I L K I T\\n\\nTHE FEAR OF MISSING\\n\\nSOMETHING IS VERY REAL.\\n\\n\\n\\nKnow the Theft or Perks Rule\\n\\nRULE 92\\n\\n218 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nSo what can you take home? Pens? Paperclips? Staplers?\\nWhen is it a perk and when is it theft? You should know this,\\nas it can come in useful if you want to have a hold over some-\\none—the someone who thinks nothing of taking home\\neverything that ain’t actually screwed down. Watch what they\\ntake, and make a mental note of it. This might come in useful.\\nYou, of course, will take nothing. \\n\\nI have known an entire department cleared out because a new\\nmanager suddenly got it into his head that they were all com-\\nmitting grand larceny because they took home copies of all the\\nsoftware used by the computers. At home they all had the\\nlatest Windows, Word, and Outlook Express but a lot of good\\nit did them when they had to sign on.\\n\\nWas it theft? It doesn’t matter. It got them the sack. If one of\\nthem had been known not to do this, they would have sur-\\nvived. If one of them had known the new manager’s views on\\nperks, they might have survived.\\n\\nBefore you start filling your pockets, make sure it is worth it.\\nAre those pens really that attractive? Will you be able to sell\\nenough cheap pens to feed your family for however long it\\ntakes you to find a new job?\\n\\nWe’ve looked at the unwritten rules of office life. One of these\\nmight be that you do take home perks. And if you choose not\\nto, make sure you don’t get labeled as a teacher’s pet or goody-\\ngoody or anything else that could get you ostracised. Be part\\nof the herd even if you steal nothing. Let your boss know you\\ndon’t, but make the staff think you are the same as they are.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd watch out for the free phone calls and the Internet con-\\nnection. These might not qualify as take home perks, but it is\\nstill theft to make free phone calls when you aren’t allowed to.\\nThere is a good chance they get monitored, so don’t do it.\\n\\nFiddling expenses can be part of the office culture. If you don’t\\ndo it, it can blow the whistle on the others who do. So what\\ndo you do? You have to be honest and above board, but you\\ncan’t rat on your colleagues. Ask the audience? Phone a\\nfriend? Doing it might seem the lesser of two evils, but you are\\na Rules Player now and can’t condone such activity.

I worked for a\\ncompany and we had a maintenance man. At the end of each\\nday, we wrote in the maintenance book anything that needed\\ndoing, such as changing light bulbs, and plunging toilets, and\\nHarry would do it. Mending broken chairs, that sort of thing.\\nWe had two offices, and I used to get quite cross that Harry\\nseemed to spend more time down at the other branch than at\\nour place. Harry was never anywhere to be found.\\n\\nMy notes in the maintenance book grew terse and sharper, but\\nit didn’t seem to do any good. I would have rollicked Harry in\\nperson if ever I’d have been able to find him. He came in after\\nwe had gone home and did the maintenance work in the\\nevenings. The other office was getting all their repairs done,\\nand we were getting nothing done. It was intolerable, and I\\nresolved one evening to wait for Harry.\\n\\nHarry didn’t show, so I went over to the other office. There\\nwas Harry having coffee with the big boss, my regional direc-\\ntor. I steamed in—“What the devil do you think you’re doing?\\nI need you over at the other place doing maintenance, not sit-\\nting here drinking coffee!” Bad mistake. Several bad mistakes:\\n\\n• You don’t bawl someone out for drinking coffee when\\nthey were on an official “ coffee-break.”\\n\\n• You don’t bawl someone out for drinking coffee when\\nthey have been invited to do so by the regional director.\\n\\n• You don’t bawl someone out in front of your regional\\ndirector without first checking all the salient facts with\\nhim.\\n\\n\\n\\n• You do things properly—go through the appropriate \\nchannels and don’t hide in wait for an errant worker.\\n\\n• You always identify the people who count—in this case,\\nHarry.\\n\\nWhy did Harry count? Because he was my regional director’s\\nfather-in-law. He had juice and power and influence that I\\ncould only dream of. He was working at the other office\\nbecause he had been told to by his son-in-law. As I said, bad\\nmistake.\\n\\nI’ve worked for companies where it was the cashier, the CEO’s\\ndriver, the accountant, and the lunch room chef who had the\\njuice. Invariably, it took some time to identify these people.\\nThey all held some trump card that gave them access to a\\nsenior boss, or had some hold over them such as being a rela-\\ntive. Find them, know them.\\n\\nRULE 93\\n\\n221K N O W T H E SY S T E M—A N D M I L K I T\\n\\nWHY DID HARRY COUNT?\\n\\nBECAUSE HE WAS MY\\n\\nREGIONAL DIRECTOR’S\\n\\nFATHER-IN-LAW.\\n\\n\\n\\nBe on the Right Side of the\\nPeople Who Count\\n\\nRULE 94\\n\\n222 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nSo how do you think I got along with Harry after my out-\\nburst? Our relationship was bad beforehand. Now it positively\\nstank. Do you think I could get a light bulb changed? No way,\\nnot now, not ever. Identifying the people who count and being\\non the right side of them go hand in hand, obviously.\\n\\nI once worked with an auditor who was a complete you-know-\\nwhat. Everything had to be done by the book. Every i dotted\\nand t crossed. This man would have made Attila the Hun look\\nlike a charity worker. But this was a man who counted. Not\\nonly was he the auditor, he seemed to have juice far beyond\\nhis role as an accountant. This was a man the senior manage-\\nment bowed to, listened to, sought advice from, dared not\\ncross, and were in fear of, and they generally treated him like\\nroyalty. \\n\\nI never quite got to the bottom of why he wielded so much\\ninfluence, but I had to work with it. And once I had identified\\nhim I had to get on the right side of him. I hadn’t been up to\\nthen. As finance manager, my department came under his\\nscrutiny constantly and closely.\\n\\nI had upset Harry at every step along the way. We didn’t \\nsee eye to eye. He was an accountant and I was a finance \\nmanager—there is quite a difference. My brief was to install\\nsecurity systems, improve cash flow, cut costs, and tighten all\\nfiscal procedures. His was to audit every penny.\\n\\nI took my kids to a garage sale one Saturday morning. It was\\nautumn and I felt cold, so I bought a college scarf at the sale.\\nYou know the sort, stripy, dark, traditional. On Monday I wore\\nit into work. I bumped into the auditor in the corridor. “Ah,”\\n\\n\\n\\nhe said “I didn’t know you went to Manchester University.\\nWell done.” And he walked off. \\n\\nI hadn’t a clue what he was talking about until it dawned on\\nme that the scarf was a Manchester University scarf. This was\\nthe university the auditor had gone to (no, I hadn’t gone there,\\nor to any university) and from then on he accepted me as one\\nof his own, a chum, an old college pal. I could do no wrong.\\n\\nThis was an accident. Since then I have engineered such inci-\\ndents to get on the right side of the people who count, the\\nones who have influence who shouldn’t. These are the ones\\nwho have juice incommensurate with their position or job.\\n\\nThere is a group of people you should watch out for—they\\noften have unaccountable juice—which includes drivers, audi-\\ntors, PR people, human resource people, assistants, people\\nwho have been with the company for a very long time, outside\\nconsultants, free agents, cashiers, ex-employees, and of\\ncourse, maintenance people!\\n\\nRULE 94\\n\\n223K N O W T H E SY S T E M—A N D M I L K I T\\n\\nTHESE ARE THE ONES \\n\\nWHO HAVE JUICE\\n\\nINCOMMENSURATE WITH\\n\\nTHEIR POSITION OR JOB.\\n\\n\\n\\nBe Well Up on New\\nManagement Techniques\\n\\nRULE 95\\n\\n224 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nYou cannot afford ever to stand still, to rest on your laurels, to\\nsit back and take it easy. All the time you are doing any of\\nthese things, there will be someone stealing up on you. \\n\\nYou have to move with the times, and that means keeping up\\nwith the latest management techniques, the newest buzz-\\nwords, whatever is executive flavor of the month. To stay top\\nof the tree, you have to know what jargon is being talked. It’s\\nno good referring to it as personnel when everyone else is\\ntalking about human resources. You’ll look a chump if you are\\nstill stuck in logistics when the board are now concentrating\\non client-focused core business or whatever.\\n\\nI’m not suggesting you have to use these new techniques, but\\nyou had better know them to stay ahead of the pack—you\\nmay be asked. You can always have fun playing buzzword\\nbingo at meetings—award yourself a point for every new\\nridiculous buzzword you hear and when you have 10 points\\nleap to your feet and shout, “Bingo!” It keeps you awake.\\n\\nAnd you’ll certainly hear a lot of wonderfully useless expres-\\nsions—for instance, what exactly does Blue Sky mean? As in,\\n“We shall have to Blue Sky this product.” It might mean, \\n“Anything goes, be creative, and set no boundaries.” It might\\nalso mean, “We’re a bunch of jargonists who want to sound\\ncool and with it but who actually sound rather silly.”\\n\\nIf you use buzzwords, try not to sound silly. You should, of\\ncourse, know what they all mean.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou should also know what all the latest management disci-\\nplines are and how they might affect you. Try not to sound\\nout of date when you talk of management techniques. For\\ninstance, it was called logistics in my day, but now it is supply\\nchain management—and by the time you are reading this it\\nwill be something else, I expect.\\n\\nYou should know what the advantages and disadvantages of\\nany of these buzzwords are just in case they crop up and you\\nwant to look good. There ought to be a sort of bluffer’s guide\\nto management speak, but I don’t think there is. You will have\\nto incorporate it into your game plan and see the big picture\\nbecause at the end of the day there will be a new ball park,\\nand the best practice of your core business will be a sort of\\nknock-on effect that will play you out of the loop if you don’t\\ntake your knowledge off-line and start thinking outside the\\nbox. That kind of thinking might just get you in with the\\nmovers and shakers without having to move your goal posts\\nor go the extra mile while playing hardball and being a show\\nstopper.

All he\\nwants is to shine at his appraisal.\\n\\nThis sort of thing goes on a lot more at work than most people\\nlike to think. Once, I volunteered to attend college every\\nMonday to do a course in payroll and double entry book-\\nkeeping. My boss thought I was keen, self-motivated, and very\\nenthusiastic. Nonsense.

I know they/we shouldn’t, but it is\\nhuman nature.

It must never depend on brownnosing,\\nfawning, obsequiousness, or flattery. You have to earn being a\\nfavorite, not worm your way in. If you do, you will be hated\\nby your colleagues. If you genuinely deserve it because you are\\ndependable or reliable or efficient or honest, then your \\ncolleagues will just about put up with it.\\n\\nSpotting the favorites in other departments should be fairly\\neasy.

A mission\\nstatement is now much more complex. If you want to make a\\nsuccess of your employment, you have to know and under-\\nstand the mission statement—and then milk it for all you are\\nworth. Quoting the mission statement earns you brownie\\npoints if you make sure it looks as if you are really on the side\\nof the company. If your boss doesn’t support the mission state-\\nment or considers such things as rubbish and not worth\\nbothering with, then keep quiet about mission statements.\\n\\nTo understand the mission statement is usually quite easy—\\nWalt Disney’s “To make people happy,” Wal-Mart’s “To give\\nordinary folk the chance to buy the same thing as rich\\npeople”—but to really understand it, you have to read all the\\nsmall print. For instance, Disney’s is quite simple but there is a\\nwhole lot more because they also have a “value statement”\\nthat covers:\\n\\n• No cynicism\\n\\n• Creativity, dreams and imagination\\n\\n• Nurturing and promulgation of “wholesome American\\nvalues”\\n\\n• Fanatical attention to consistency and detail\\n\\n• Preservation and control of the Disney “magic”\\n\\nIf you can’t find something here—assuming you work for\\nDisney—to milk, you aren’t worthy of calling yourself a Rules\\nPlayer.

If it’s your immediate colleagues, chances are you\\nknow full well who is interested and who isn’t. Staff from\\nother departments should be identified by checking your\\nsources—you should have the ear of every favorite in every\\ndepartment (see Rule 97). Staff from other branches present a\\nbit of a challenge, but you should use your contacts for such\\ninformation (Rule 52). Candidates from other disciplines\\nwithin the same organization are the real test. Often you won’t\\nknow about them until they suddenly appear at the interview\\nstage. When I worked for American Express way back in the\\nearly 1970s, I was in line for a promotion to department\\nsupervisor. I had eliminated all the potential competition from\\namong my own colleagues, checked out the opposition from\\nother departments and branches—there wasn’t any—and felt\\nsecure and relaxed when, hey presto, a new candidate\\nappeared from a completely separate but parallel discipline.

But you can\\n\\n• See the advert before it goes to press and have a pretty\\ngood idea of what is being asked for\\n\\n• Use contacts to find out who is on the shortlist from out-\\nside\\n\\n• Again use contacts to find out who is being called for\\ninterview and what sort of competition you are up against\\n\\nRemember that knowledge is power. You may not like what\\nyou find out, but at least you will know.\\n\\nRULE 99\\n\\n237H A N D L E T H E O P P O S I T I O N\\n\\nUSE CONTACTS TO FIND\\n\\nOUT WHO IS BEING \\n\\nCALLED FOR INTERVIEW\\n\\nAND WHAT SORT OF\\n\\nCOMPETITION YOU ARE UP\\n\\nAGAINST.\\n\\n\\n\\nStudy Them Closely\\n\\nRULE 100\\n\\n238 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nIf you are going for a promotion and there is competition, you\\nneed to read, understand, and completely grasp what is being\\nasked for. You need to tailor your resume, application docu-\\nment, and interview technique so that you fully fit the picture\\nof the ideal candidate. And you have to study what the compe-\\ntition is doing. Suppose the job is for a supervisory\\ndepartmental head of the computer sales division. You know\\nthat you have\\n\\n• Experience of sales\\n\\n• Experience of computers\\n\\n• But little experience of supervising other staff\\n\\nNow check out the opposition. Suppose there are two other \\ncandidates:\\n\\n• Tony has a good working knowledge of the products and\\ngood supervisory experience but knows nothing about\\nsales.\\n\\n• Sandra is good on the sales side and has excellent super-\\nvisory experience but doesn’t understand the product at\\nall.\\n\\nWho is the ideal candidate? It depends entirely on what the\\nmanagement is looking for—or what they think they are look-\\ning for. The job obviously needs three parts—sales, product\\nknowledge and supervisory duties. You have two out of\\nthree—as do the other two candidates. But which one is the\\nmost important to the management? You need to check this\\nout carefully:\\n\\n\\n\\n• Read the job description\\n\\n• Liaise with whoever is doing the job now\\n\\n• Research what the management is thinking\\n\\nIf the focus is on one of the two areas you are strong in, then\\nyou have already eliminated one of the candidates. Now it’s a\\ntwo-horse race. If, however, the third option is the focus—\\nsupervision—the one area you are weak in, then you will have\\nto swing the focus more toward your own skills and experi-\\nence. At interview you will have to find good reasons why\\nyour lack of experience doesn’t discount you—talk up the\\nproduct and how essential it is to have a good knowledge of it\\nand its potential, talk up the importance of sales and how the\\ndepartment lives or dies by its sales record.\\n\\nObviously, this is just an example; the real world is much\\nmore complicated.\\n\\nRULE 100\\n\\n239H A N D L E T H E O P P O S I T I O N\\n\\nWHO IS THE \\n\\nIDEAL CANDIDATE? \\n\\nIT  DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON\\n\\nWHAT THE MANAGEMENT\\n\\nIS LOOKING FOR.\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t Back-Stab\\n\\nRULE 101\\n\\n240 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nThe one thing you won’t do in your race to the top is back-\\nstab. You will not take out the opposition by unlawful means.\\nIt is OK to talk up your own talents and skills and to cleverly\\ninfluence what management is looking for by highlighting\\nyour own expertise and the implied failings of your competi-\\ntion. You can imply, suggest, and insinuate. What you cannot\\ndo is state openly and honestly why you think they are use-\\nless. You make out that they are not up to the promotion by\\ngetting the management to focus on how good you are, not by\\npointing out how bad they are.\\n\\nThe things you do not do are\\n\\n• Bad-mouth the opposition\\n\\n• Back-stab the competition\\n\\n• Speak ill of anyone\\n\\n• Tell lies about the other contestants (see Rule 48)\\n\\n• Reveal secret information about the competition that you\\nhave found out that could affect their chances\\n\\n• Steal information\\n\\n• Peek, pry, or spy\\n\\nThese are what you must not do. But what can you do then?\\nWell, you can\\n\\n• Use any contacts you have to find out the calibre of the\\ncompetition\\n\\n• Enhance your own attributes creatively based on what the\\nmanagement is looking for\\n\\n\\n\\n• Talk up your own good points, highlighting special skills\\nand expertise you have that they are lacking—you don’t\\nsay they haven’t got what it takes; you make sure the\\nmanagement knows that you do\\n\\n• Sell management something they may not have even\\nknown they wanted, which the opposition hasn’t got\\n\\nRULE 101\\n\\n241H A N D L E T H E O P P O S I T I O N\\n\\nTHE ONE THING YOU\\n\\nWON’T DO IN YOUR RACE\\n\\nTO THE TOP IS BACK-STAB.\\n\\n\\n\\nKnow the Psychology of\\nPromotion\\n\\nRULE 102\\n\\n242 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nSuppose a vacancy has arisen internally. You quite fancy the\\njob, it fits in with your game plan, and you could do with the\\nextra money. You have the expertise, the experience, and the\\nqualifications. You think you will apply for the post. All well\\nand good. But what is being decided here? And what are the\\ncriteria being used?\\n\\nYou think job X is vacant; therefore, person Y will fill the post\\njust so long as she has the right attributes. But what are the\\nright attributes? Oh, I know you’ll say\\n\\n• Experience\\n\\n• Qualifications \\n\\n• Expertise\\n\\nJust like you’ve got, and that’s why you are a perfect candidate.\\nNot quite true, I’m afraid. There is usually a whole lot more\\ngoing on than you know. For instance, the post may be being\\nadvertised because\\n\\n• Head office says it has to be but your management has no\\nintention of filling it.\\n\\n• Your manager has already unofficially filled it—it’s been\\noffered to someone already in secret.\\n\\n• The job is being downsized; it will go to someone who\\nwill be made redundant in six months’ time,\\n\\n• The whole exercise is a waste of time. The person already\\ndoing the job has resigned but he is going to withdraw\\nthat at the last minute—he’s just holding out for more\\nmoney at the moment.\\n\\n\\n\\n• It’s an exercise in getting rid of someone; they’ll offer it to\\nsomeone completely unsuitable so they have grounds to\\nsack the person, which they can’t do in their current \\nposition\\n\\n• The job is being created so the manager can give it to\\ntheir favorite/lover/friend/relative/blackmailer.\\n\\nI don’t want to make you paranoid, but there are a million and\\none reasons why you may not get the job despite being, on\\npaper, the best person for it. There may also be a million rea-\\nsons why you shouldn’t apply. You have to know all this.\\nStudy the psychology of whatever is being offered. It may not\\nbe quite what it seems.\\n\\nRULE 102\\n\\n243H A N D L E T H E O P P O S I T I O N\\n\\nSTUDY THE PSYCHOLOGY\\n\\nOF WHATEVER IS BEING\\n\\nOFFERED. IT  MAY NOT BE\\n\\nQUITE WHAT IT SEEMS.\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t Give Too Much Away\\n\\nRULE 103\\n\\n244 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nIt is probably advisable not to tell anyone that you\\n\\n• Intend on applying for a new position within the com-\\npany\\n\\n• Intend on applying for a new job outside of the company\\n\\n• Are thinking of leaving anyway\\n\\n• Are thinking of asking for a pay rise\\n\\n• Are thinking of changing your working schedules\\n\\n• Are a Rules Player\\n\\nDon’t blab to anyone of anything you are doing. It might be\\nseen as bragging—a Rules Player never brags about anything,\\nwe are quiet humility itself—or it might give rise to gossip,\\nand we know the Rule about that, don’t we? And the truth is\\nthat even if you only tell one person things leak out. She tells\\nher closest friend and he tells his. And so on it goes until you\\nare being hauled before the boss and interrogated as to why\\nyou are leaving next Monday when all you had done was say\\nyou were thinking about it to Susan in the break room. If you\\ndo reveal stuff about yourself, you are open to\\n\\n• Rumor, gossip, and an opportunity for others to possibly\\nuse it against you\\n\\n• Giving the opposition an unfair advantage\\n\\n• Giving the management information they shouldn’t be\\nprivy to at this stage\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t even allow yourself the privilege of thinking out loud.\\nKeep your own counsel, and you won’t go far wrong. What\\nyou intend doing is entirely up to you. If you need informa-\\ntion and anyone asks you why you need it, invent something\\nentirely bogus. No, this is not lying; it is throwing someone off\\nthe scent. Don’t lie, but you can be circumspect, devious,\\ninventive, creative, eccentric, and you are allowed to set up a\\ndecoy.\\n\\nIf someone asks you directly if you are thinking about apply-\\ning for a particular position, you can always brush it off, “Oh,\\nalways thinking about applying.” Does this mean yes or no?\\nRemember: don’t lie and say, “No,” when it is plainly untrue\\nand will be seen to be such when you do apply. \\n\\nRULE 103\\n\\n245H A N D L E T H E O P P O S I T I O N\\n\\nKEEP YOUR OWN COUNSEL,\\n\\nAND YOU WON’T GO \\n\\nFAR WRONG.\\n\\n\\n\\nKeep Your Ear to the Ground\\n\\nRULE 104\\n\\n246 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nIf you don’t know what is going on, how can you make\\ninformed decisions or coordinate your career plan? It might be\\nas simple as someone applying for a position you had in mind.\\nIf that person is more experienced, better qualified, and has\\nmore expertise and skill in that area, then you might be sensi-\\nble holding back. If you don’t you will probably fail—and a\\nRules Player is always successful.\\n\\nNow you don’t want gossip; you want hard facts. You want to\\nknow what is going on without having to listen to gossip and\\nidle chit-chat. Therefore, it makes sense to\\n\\n• Use your contacts for information from other \\ndepartments\\n\\n• Pay attention at meetings—it is often surprising how\\nmuch information you can pick up by reading between\\nthe lines\\n\\n• Watch and listen for the “hidden agendas”—what people\\nare saying might mask what is really going on\\n\\n• Cultivate the office favorite/s and you’ll find that they\\ninvariably know stuff mere mortals aren’t privy to—you’ll\\njust have to get them to spill the beans\\n\\n• Keep abreast of things like the trade press as you may\\npick up bits of information that have been “leaked” to the\\npress before the rank and file have been told—that new\\nmerger, the takeover, the acquisition of a rival company,\\nall these can be useful snippets of information that can\\nput you one step ahead of colleagues and competitors\\n\\n\\n\\nA lot of people don’t get anywhere with their job because they\\nspend far too much time doing their job. You need to get your\\nhead up from time to time and look around you. You might\\nfind the herd has moved on while you were busy feeding and\\nnow you are alone and forgotten. \\n\\nRULE 104\\n\\n247H A N D L E T H E O P P O S I T I O N\\n\\nYOU NEED TO GET YOUR\\n\\nHEAD UP FROM TIME TO\\n\\nTIME AND LOOK \\n\\nAROUND YOU.\\n\\n\\n\\nMake the Opposition Seem\\nIrreplaceable\\n\\nRULE 105\\n\\n248 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nWe have looked at why you can’t indulge in any back-\\nstabbing—Rule 101: Don’t Back-Stab—and you know you can’t\\nsay anything bad about anyone, but all the same, one of the\\ncompetition is getting in a bit too close with the boss and it\\nlooks like that promotion might just go their way. What do\\nyou do? You make them seem irreplaceable, of course. But you\\ndo it by pointing out all the important but mundane jobs they\\ndo. You point out their strengths to your boss in the boring,\\nhumdrum areas. “God, I don’t know what we’d do without\\nRachael to do the filing. She must be a Virgo—she’s so good at\\nthat sort of stuff.” But you are only going to point out things\\nthat your rival is genuinely good at. We are not going to lie—\\nRule 48: Never Lie—but merely praise the competition for a\\nparticular skill. And a skill that they can best exercise right\\nwhere they are.\\n\\nYour boss is your customer—you sell your services to them.\\nYour colleagues are the competition. If you were selling cars\\nand someone asked if the next garage sold better cars, what\\nwould you say? You wouldn’t say, “Yes, they sell much better\\ncars than us—and cheaper; in fact you ought to go straight\\nthere and buy one of theirs right now.” But you also wouldn’t\\nsay anything bad—“Their cars are all stolen”—though you\\nmight well say, “Their cars are fine but they appeal to a differ-\\nent customer; they sell more family saloons than we do.” You\\nhaven’t lied. You have indirectly flattered your customer—the\\nimplication being, “You obviously need a much more up-\\nmarket executive car than those shoddy little boxes they sell\\nnext door”—but you haven’t said anything bad. \\n\\n\\n\\nYou can also get your rival colleague to ask questions of them-\\nselves about the new position: “If you did get Richard’s job,\\nhow do you think you’d cope with all those meetings? I\\nremember your telling me you hated meetings.” Hopefully\\nshe’ll think about all those dreary interminable, intimidating\\nmeetings and may well back off. You, on the other hand, find\\nthem stimulating, exciting, and very productive—and you\\nhaven’t said anything bad, merely asked a simple question.\\nYou’ll get them to want to stay right where they are—they’ll\\nmake themselves irreplaceable.\\n\\nRULE 105\\n\\n249H A N D L E T H E O P P O S I T I O N\\n\\nYOUR BOSS IS YOUR\\n\\nCUSTOMER.

It isn’t.\\nEverything has to be meant, genuine, and honest. Don’t praise\\nthem. Not unless you really mean it. It is so easy to undermine\\nsomeone by using praise when you are actually being rather\\nhorrid and stitching them up. You may think this a clever\\napproach. It isn’t. You will be seen through immediately and\\ncome across as shallow, vindictive, and really rather ruthless.\\nRemember: If you can’t say anything nice—shut up? Well, you\\nmay think that you can get away with saying nasty things, dis-\\nguised as nice things, but you can’t. This is the sort of thing\\nthat is forbidden:\\n\\n• “Oh, I know Bill is brilliantly wacky. He is such an inde-\\npendent thinker. He really does operate outside of the\\nbox; he’s so original and off the wall.” \\n\\nWhat you’re really saying: he’s a lone wolf who is slightly mad\\nand shouldn’t be trusted supervising a chimps’ coffe break let\\nalone an entire department:\\n\\n• “Bill is such a determined worker. He doesn’t care how\\nmuch it costs; he goes for the last detail of a job. Superb\\nresolution. He likes to see things through to the very end,\\nno matter what. I admire his ability to just see not just the\\ndollar signs on a project but the application.” \\n\\nWhat you’re really saying: he should never be trusted with his\\nown money, let alone someone else’s:\\n\\n\\n\\n• “Bill really is one of the guys. He really knows how to let\\nhis hair down and have fun. I admire his ability to hold\\nhis liquor. If there’s a wacky stunt going on, Bill is always\\nin the thick of it; he is such a free spirit and so youth ori-\\nentated.”\\n\\nWhat you’re really saying: he’s a drunk, a bit wild, not to be\\ntrusted looking after staff,s and he has the mental age of a\\nteenager:\\n\\n• “We can’t keep Bill in the office. He’s such a live wire. I\\ndon’t think our little cage is big enough for someone with\\nthat much energy. I envy him. I sit here doing the paper-\\nwork while he’s off, out there talking to customers and\\nliaising and being brilliant at sales.” \\n\\nWhat you’re really saying: Bill is crap at paperwork. Don’t get\\ninto this trap. Your seniors will see through it, and if they are\\ndecent people they aren’t going to like it.\\n\\nRULE 106\\n\\n251H A N D L E T H E O P P O S I T I O N\\n\\nWELL,  YOU MAY THINK\\n\\nTHAT YOU CAN GET AWAY\\n\\nWITH SAYING NASTY\\n\\nTHINGS,  DISGUISED \\n\\nAS NICE THINGS,  BUT \\n\\nYOU CAN’T.\\n\\n\\n\\nCapitalize on the \\nCareer-Enhancing Moments\\n\\nRULE 107\\n\\n252 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nEvery now and then there is a break from the routine, the\\nhumdrum, the everyday.

Why me? Oh\\nLord, why me?”\\n\\n\\n\\nYou, on the other hand, know this rule—this is a career-\\nenhancing moment and you had better take the opportunity to\\nshine.

You will be grown up but still a lot of fun to be\\naround. You need the support of your fellow coworkers to\\nmove up, and you need their friendship and approval. If you\\ndon’t have these things, you open yourself up to the possibility\\nof being set up, pulled down, dumped upon, or seen off. But\\nhow do you cultivate their friendship and approval when you\\nare doing everything to get promoted above them, to be their\\nboss?\\n\\nWhat you have to do is be one of the girls/guys while retaining\\na modicum of detachment. You have to run with the sheep\\nand hunt with the wolves. You have to be “one of them” and\\none of the bosses.\\n\\nYou’ll need to socialize with the staff without losing control,\\ngetting drunk, sleeping with any of them, or getting involved.\\nLaugh at their jokes, but don’t go on vacation with them.\\nListen to their troubles, but don’t tell them they are trivial or\\ninconsequential. Support them and nurture them when they\\nare under pressure, but remain calm at all times yourself. You\\nhave to become their mother hen at the same time as their\\nfriend and fellow conspirator. You have to listen to their com-\\nplaints and moans about management and the boss without\\nrevealing who you really are—their eventual new boss.\\n\\nYou have to help them with their work so they get to rely on\\nyou. You have to be the diplomat, the conciliator, the referee,\\nthe pal, and the priest. You have to get them to love you\\nbecause you are so nice, so friendly yourself. \\n\\n\\n\\nYou have to be their tower of strength and their prop and their\\nchum. You have to make them feel special, feel that without\\nyou their lives are gray and dull and boring. You have to be\\nthe life and soul of the party and the party organizer and the\\none who clears up afterward.\\n\\nAll this is possible—not easy but possible. If you get on the\\nright side of your colleagues to such an extent, it will be they\\nwho push you forward, they whot want you to be their boss,\\ndemand of you that you lead. You will be the Rules Player par\\nexcellence.\\n\\nRULE 108\\n\\n255H A N D L E T H E O P P O S I T I O N\\n\\nLAUGH AT THEIR JOKES,\\n\\nBUT DON’T GO ON\\n\\nVACATION WITH THEM.\\n\\n\\n\\n256 T H E R U L E S O F W O R K\\n\\nKnow When to Break the Rules\\n\\nPOSTSCRIPT\\n\\nMany excellent and committed Rules Players I meet start out\\nfollowing every Rule. When you’re first setting out, this is a\\nsensible approach. After all, the alternative is complacency\\nand an assurance that “I can do this stuff,” which certainly\\nisn’t true. None of us finds every situation effortless. It may be\\nclear what we should do, but that doesn’t always mean it’s\\neasy. And sometimes we’re not sure which way to go.\\n\\nSo, by all means start out taking each Rule seriously. That’s the\\ngeneral idea. However, as you become more comfortable and\\nself-assured as a Rules Player and begin to develop sound\\ninstincts for Rules behavior, you can begin to loosen up. Many\\nof the Rules will become automatic, and you’ll no longer have\\nto think about them. And once you reach this stage, you’ll find\\nthat occasionally one of the Rules really isn’t quite appropriate.\\n\\nIt’s no good persuading yourself a Rule doesn’t fit because\\nyou’d much rather not have to follow it. You need to be clear\\nand objective. But when your instincts genuninely tell you to\\nbreak a Rule, then go for it.\\n\\nPersonally, I find that there’s rarely a need to break a Rule. I do\\nbreak Rules occasionally. For example, a Rules Player never\\ndeliberately belittles other people in public, but about twice in\\nmy life I’ve encountered people who really needed to be belit-\\ntled in public to stop them from doing it to others.\\n\\nIn the end it’s about gut feeling. Follow the Rules until they’re\\nso ingrained they become instinct, and then trust your\\ninstincts. If you refer back to the Rules from time to time, and\\nyou work on the ones you find tricky, you can be confident\\nthat in time your instincts will serve you better than any book.\\n\\n\\n\\tContents\\n\\tForeword\\n\\tIntroduction\\n\\tPart I: Walk Your Talk\\n\\t1 Get Your Work Noticed\\n\\t2 Never Stand Still\\n\\t3 Volunteer Carefully\\n\\t4 Carve Out a Niche for
